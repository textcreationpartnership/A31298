            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Ingenious Reader, THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE deſire of Travel, and Voyag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſtant Lands, is ſo Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to an Active Genious, that but few who have not had the opportunity of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in Action, have been no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable of ſuch an improving undertaking. By what is viſible in one's Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, there is no exalted Mind but muſt conſequently tend to a higher elevation in Knowledge, to furniſh it with a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe wonderful things the ſcanty Globe Communicates to the Sight and Senſes, ſo to enable one to give a true Judgment in difference of Countries, and
<pb facs="tcp:57084:3"/> what is Rare and Remarkable in them. To this end, Princes have laid aſide their Regal Ornaments, and the exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Pleaſures of Thrones for a time, taking on them the Fateigue of long Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, through many dangers and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that ſo they might inform themſelves of the certainty of things, and Affairs worthy to be entertained in the repoſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Royal Breaſts, and to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of Majeſty. I need not enumerate Ancient Examples for this, one very Modern may ſuffice, to evidence Truth of what I Atteſt. It is well known how the Great and Powerful Czar of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> in the midſt of War ſhroud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Majeſty in a mean diſguiſe; left his Spacious Country and Armies Conteſting with the mighty Nations of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> making a tedious Journey to inform himſelf in thoſe Matters; of which, at Home, he conceived he had but an imperfect Relation; alſo to polliſh his pregnant Genious in the refined Courts of other Princes, and in all probability
<pb facs="tcp:57084:3"/> met with a ſatisfaction that made him conclude his Time and Travel well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed and undertaken.</p>
            <p>I need not much enforce an Argument to perſwade the Ingenious that Travel, renders a Man very much accompliſhed, and often raiſes his Fortune above the common level. It has been ſeen in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern Ages, whilſt ſuch as have ſupinely loytered away their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Life, under the umbrage of their own Manſion, have made no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the World, whilſt they remained in it; and when they dropt from the ſtage of Mortality were ſoon wrapped in Oblivion. But to come ſomewhat nearer to my purpoſe;</p>
            <p>In this Hiſtory of my Travels through many vaſt Countries, I have been very exact to ſet down nothing but what with much Care and Circumſpection occurrred to me; where any thing is mentioned, as by Hear-ſay, which is but ſcanty. I
<pb facs="tcp:57084:4"/> had it in Converſing with thoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and, as I nearly conclude, of much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, every thing bearing a probability and conſonance to Truth. The whole Work is free from Impoſſibilities, or any thing that may carry the face of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Stories or Fables, you may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive in Reading, where I was an occular and aureal Witneſs, and where I had only informations from others, which contribute but a very little part of what I have Written. I have as much as poſſible affected Brevity, and muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay, that none who have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, have in Large Volumes comprized ſo much material matter. I Writ it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed at firſt for the refreſhing my own memory, but my Friends, who on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions had been Dear to me, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient that it ſhould rest in Silence, and ſwayed me even againſt my inclinations, to let it go abroad; (for not without ſome Reluctancy) I ſubmitted to their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and the many reaſons they urged to Frame or Mould me to a temper of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying.
<pb facs="tcp:57084:4"/> And now it is abroad, I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together perſwaded, it cannot but be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to my ingenious Countrymen, nay, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Neighbouring Nations; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conſtrains me to imagin, it will not altogether be confined within the narrow compaſs of a ſingle Iſland, when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it ſelf ſo great a ſhare of the World, and all that is worthy of Note in the Countries it mentions, and thoſe the moſt Famed in the Univerſe. I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted it into a Method ſuitable for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of all intelligent Capacities, and formed it in Chapters, that any thing deſired may be the ſooner found out, or turn'd to; yet the Contents mention not the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars at full, but only ſome as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to the reſt; for the matter being Conciſe and Compact, ſhould I bring every thing under the heads mentioned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they would ſwell too much, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be tedious to the Reader, ſeeing ſuch a method is a kind of doubling what is the ſubſequent, and an Anticipateing the the Readers Expectation.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57084:5"/>
            <p> To Conclude, I preſent you with Truth and Variety, and ſo reſting on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Reader's good Nature, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality for a candid Conſtruction of this Work, I take leave to ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

               </head>
               <p>INSPIRED by the Fame of diſtant Lands, by ſeeing what's rare and Worthy of Note nearer Home, I debated with my ſelf whether the latter ought not to ſuffice my curioſity, and laboured very much to enforce it for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reaſons; but neither that, nor the Charge, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and Hardſhips I was like to meet with in Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging tempeſtuous Seas, nor Travelling ſtrange
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57084:6"/> Countries, had any ſuch prevalent Effect upon me as to ſurmount the eager Inclination and reſtleſs Deſire I had to be an Eye-witneſs of thoſe things I had often heard, though imperfectly, in Relation to what they have ſince appear'd. This great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve labouring in my Mind, my Friends could not chuſe but take notice of ſome great alteration in me, and their preſſing deſires to know the cauſe of unuſual Emotions that were too evident, conſtrain'd me to open my ſelf freely, which at firſt did not a little ſtartle them; but perceiving I was fully bent on the undertaking, and that all their perſwaſions to the contrary were fruitleſs, they aſſiſted me with a ſupply in a great meaſure to carry on my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; and ſo having prepared every thing I then thought neceſſary, we parted with good Wiſhes, Prayers and Tears.</p>
               <p>I ſent my Cargo on Board a Merchant's Ship lying over-againſt <hi>Eriffe,</hi> in the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> on the 30th of <hi>April</hi> 1684, and travelling over-land, went on Board myſelf when ſhe was fallen to the <hi>Downs.</hi> It will be needleſs to tell you what Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I made with the Maſter who was my Friend, and uſed me extream well during my Voyage, or how I ſpent my time e'er we quitted the Lands end; let it ſuffice we were driven back by ſtreſs of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and forced to put in at ſeveral places with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ships in our Company, before we had a fair Wind to carry us out to Sea; but at length Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo ordered it, that the Wind came about as well as we could wiſh, and we loſt no time to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ſo favourable an opportunity; but getting out of Harbour, where we had lain for Ten days Wind bound, in a few hours ſailing <hi>England</hi> diſappeared, but Night coming on, the Sun ſetting with a dusky Cloud a thwart it, and darting its Beams Pale to either Pole, the Mariners obſerved by that and ſome other Signs they have, that a Storm threatned us; nor were they deceived in their Conjecture, for the Wind aroſe by degrees, and about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night it was a full Storm, but with ſome difficulty
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57084:6"/> we weather'd it, for about the riſing of the Sun the Wind ſlackned and we kept on our way; yet this toſsing a little indiſpoſed me, ſo that all that day I kept my Cabin, but for the moſt part after this the Seas and Winds contended as it were to give us a favourable paſſage to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whither this Ship was bound upon ſome particular occaſions as well as that of Trade, which I do not conceive pertinent to this Relation of my own Travels, nor ſhall I deſcribe, as ſome ſuperfluouſly do, all the Coaſts we made in our Sailing: Let it ſuffice then that we touched not till we came to <hi>Meſſina</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> though in our paſſage I ſaw the Fires of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Stromboli,</hi> which in the night time looked dreadful, though at a great diſtance, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the People who live near it conceive a fooliſh opinion, that it is an entrance into Hell, becauſe when the Fire makes its Irruptions they hear howlings as of the Damned, which is no more than the Winds breaking through the hollow Rockey Caverns in the Mountain, waſted by the long continuance of the burning, which makes a confuſed noiſe, that at a diſtance reſembles howling.</p>
               <p>Paſſing the Fare of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> we came before the Town, and dropt Anchor without the Port, where thoſe that would had leave to go a-ſhore; I failed not to do it, and whilſt the Sailers were employed in taking in ſome neceſſaries, I took a ſlight view of the place. It lies on that ſide the Iſland that looks to <hi>Rhegio</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> from which it is 60 miles diſtant, where the Ancient Town of <hi>Zande</hi> ſtood: Nature has furniſhed it with a pleaſant and ſafe Harbour, which for its compactneſs may be thought to have been made by Art. The Buildings that adorn the Port are Regular and Uniform, ſo that they give a pleaſant proſpect at the end of the Mole that ſhuts in the Port: There is a Tower well fortified to ſecure the entry, and about the middle of it is another Tower, on the top of it a a great Light to guide Ships in the Night; The Streets of the Town are fair and large; The Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57084:7"/> is very ſtately, and over the Door in large Characters is Written, <hi>Gran-Mercy a Meſſine.</hi> When the <hi>French</hi> became Maſters of the Iſland, it was the firſt place that Surrendered, and <hi>Sicily</hi> cauſed and beheld the fatal Tragedy of the Intruders, for a deſign was ſecretly laid and carried on, ſo that on a ſet day, when the Bell rung to Evening Song, which was the Sign, the Inhabitants of the Iſland Maſſacred all the French Nation without ſparing Women or Children, which is ſtill called the Fatal <hi>Sicilian</hi> Veſper. Before the Church is a ſquare Piazza, with a Theatre in the middle, where the Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Turkiſh Naval Forces is repreſented in Braſs, and in the ſame Metal ſtands the Statue of Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Spaniſh Admiral, in that Expedition. The Country is very Fruitful, abounds in Sulphur Mines, and much ſubject to Earthquakes. The next Town of note is <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> where the famous <hi>Archimedes</hi> made his Experiments, and fired the <hi>Roman</hi> Navy that beſieged it with Burning-Glaſſes. There is a Caſtle built on the Rocks called <hi>Scyla,</hi> and the Water beating on theſe Rocks reſembles the barking of Dogs. As for <hi>Charibais</hi> it is oppoſite to the Port of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and not dangerous, but when two contrary Eddies meet and make a kind of a whirlpool, ſo that ſometimes Ships turn round and are ſucked in, which gave occaſion to Fable them two Sea Monſters ſet there to deſtroy Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, though there are Pilots always ready at the general Charge to guide Ships in and out. The Viceroy has his Reſidence here ſix Months, and as many at <hi>Palermo. Mount Gibello,</hi> anciently called <hi>Aetna,</hi> much infects this fruitful Iſland with its firey Irruptions. The Sicilians are very hauty, Proud, and exceeding Jealous of the Spaniards under whoſe Government they are.</p>
               <p>From hence ſetting Sail, we directed our Courſe to <hi>Maltha,</hi> and having Coaſted <hi>Sicily,</hi> there ſprung up an Eaſt North Eaſt Wind, before which we drove a very ſwift Sailing, and ſoon made the Iſle of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> in the Port of which we came to an Anchor.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57084:7"/> It lies in the <hi>African</hi> Sea, between <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Tripoly,</hi> in the Latitude of 38 degrees, and in Longitude 34, extending from Eaſt to Weſt 29 Miles, and is about 12 over; all the Earth is exceeding White; its Ancient Name was <hi>Melita.</hi> In the Year 1530 the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> gave it, and the Iſle of <hi>Gozo,</hi> to the Knights who were driven out of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and they have ever ſince poſſeſſed it in ſpite of all the efforts the Turks have made. It ſeems to be a Rock with very little Earth on it, yet it bears Fruit and Corn, but they are moſtly ſupplied from <hi>Sicily,</hi> it lying but 20 Leagues diſtant. Here St. Paul on his landing in his paſſage to <hi>Rome</hi> ſhook off the Viper; they ſhow his Grott, and the Earth is dug there, and carried away for many Phyſical uſes. The Natives wear Green Spectacles to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their Eyes from Dazling, by reaſon of the whiteneſs of the Earth. The Knights of the Order are under a great Maſter. They have many advantageous Ports well defended, and are formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable at Sea with their Galleys to the Moors of Barbary and Turks; for if they take them they make 'em Slaves. The Towns of <hi>Maltha</hi> are well ſcituate and defended; they have good Magazines, and always keep a good Proviſion of Arms and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Stores. They are very charitable to Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, eſpecially the Sick, providing for them in their Hoſpitals while they ſtay, and pay the charges of their Voyage when they depart.</p>
               <p>The Wind being again fair, we left <hi>Maltha,</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Cape of <hi>Metapan</hi> and Iſle of <hi>Cerigo,</hi> the Ancient Porphyrus and Citherea, where former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtood a Magnificent Temple to <hi>Venus,</hi> the ruins of which, as I was told, are ſtill to be ſeen near the Sea; and meeting with a ſtorm, we were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to caſt Anchor before the Iſland of <hi>Zia,</hi> which in Ancient times was called <hi>Calle Ceos</hi> or <hi>Cea;</hi> it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 50 Miles in Circuit, ſhaped like a Horſe-ſhoe; the Soil produces Wine, Corn, good Paſture, and many other uſeful things; the Harbour is ſtored with Fiſh, the Inhabitants are very civil to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57084:8"/> the Women wear their Coats but to their Knees, and their Smocks about a Foot below that, with a Veil reaching their Breaſts, which they turn aſide as they think fit; when they will or will not Compliment any but lying in War's way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Turks and Venetians, they are much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and impoveriſhed, otherways the plenty of the Iſland would inrich them.</p>
               <p>Sailing from hence we made the Iſle of <hi>Andra:</hi> This is the Ancient <hi>Andros</hi> of the Greeks, but now Inhabited by People of ſeveral Nations, as <hi>Albani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Armenians, Turks, Jews, &amp;c.</hi> and theſe differ in Cuſtoms as well as Languages, very rude and unhoſpitable; the Chief Towns are <hi>Arni</hi> and <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacos.</hi> The Greeks have ſeveral Churches in this Iſland, but the People are very Superſtitious and odd in their Devotions, ſtrowing Flowers, and rowling in them; but the Latins who have likewiſe Churches there, are more Civilized, and proceed Regular: The Iſland is very Fruitful, and here they make abundance of white wicker Baskets uſed all over the <hi>Archipelago.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Weighing Anchor, we got out to Sea, and ſtood to the Starboard, paſſing between this Iſland and <hi>Negropont,</hi> and having a South-weſt Wind, <hi>Sciro,</hi> and ſoon after <hi>Iſpi Cera,</hi> and ſome other places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. In the Evening when we were pretty clear of Iſlands, the Wind turned Eaſt South Eaſt, and we ſoon made the Land where <hi>Troy</hi> ſtood, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of whoſe Ruins remain; for we had paſſed <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedos</hi> in the Night, ſo paſſing the Mouths we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Channel of the <hi>Heleſpont,</hi> the place where the Turks paſſed from <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Europe</hi> to extend their Empire.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the</hi> Heleſpont, Dardanelles, <hi>Places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, what is obſervable in</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople <hi>and its adjacents; Containing all that is Curious and Remarkable in theſe Parts.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Gate, or Entrance, as it were, to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> being by the <hi>Heleſpont</hi> and <hi>Dardanelles,</hi> I think it here convenient to ſay ſomething of this fam'd Streight before I come a Land; It lies in 37 Degrees, 42 Minutes, North Latitude, and of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude about 55, not extending above 10 or 12 Leagues in length, and at the entrance it is a large League and an half broad; it divides the Country of <hi>Thrace</hi> from <hi>Troas</hi> a Province of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that lies to the Eaſt: To the North lies the <hi>Propontis,</hi> and to the South the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea, and the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> and in Sailing here one has a proſpect of divers fine Towns, Villages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a curious Country on either Hand.</p>
               <p>The Turks knowing the important advantage of this Streight, have Fortified the Paſſage with two ſtrong Caſtles, one in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the other in <hi>Aſia;</hi> the Caſtle built in <hi>Aſia,</hi> called the <hi>New Caſtle,</hi> is ſeated on a tongue of Land pointing out into the Sea on a ſquare Platform, comprizing 4 large panes of Walls, flanked at the four Corners with Towers; thoſe next the Sea, ſquare with a ſort of Redoubt only on one ſide; thoſe toward the Land are round, and defend the Walls, but neither in thickneſs nor largeneſs comparable to the other; the Works waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Sea have Port-holes level with the ſurface of the Water, and I could number as I Sailed by,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57084:9"/> about 40 Cannon mounted, to prevent any Ships from forcing their way into the Harbour; and to the South of this Caſtle ſtands a very fair Moſque.</p>
               <p>The Caſtle on the European ſide, which the Turks call <hi>Roumeli-inglu-iſſar,</hi> is ſeated near to Cape <hi>Greco,</hi> and in form is irregular; within the compaſs of the Walls are Houſes for the Aga, and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, with a fair Moſque. There is a Platform on which many great Guns are planted, lying equal with the ſurface of the Water. Near the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle lies a ſmall Village noted for its Five ſtately Pilaſters, that ſerve to underprop the Aquaducts bringing Water to the Fortreſs. But notwithſtand-theſe Caſtles, whoſe Guns reach from Shore to Shore, the Venetians, and other Maritime Nations, have inſulted the Harbour, for the Caſtles lie not directly oppoſite, leaſt in firing they ſhould batter each other. The Caſtles are appointed to examine Ships that paſs and re-paſs, and the Governors have Orders to ſink ſuch Ships as will not comply: Beyond theſe Caſtles that are of Modern building are two old Caſtles, one on each ſhore; that on the Aſian ſide the Turks call <hi>Natoli-jski-jſiar;</hi> it is of ſquare Building, flanked at the corners with Towers, and in the midſt of it is a large ſquare Tower, on which ſome Culverin is placed; and behind this Caſtle is a large Village of about 3000 Inhabitants, Chriſtians, Turks, and Jews; Theſe by us are called the Caſtles of the <hi>Dardanelles.</hi> That on the European ſide is of a Regular Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and indeed we may eſteem this narrow Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage well guarded by theſe Caſtles, and <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> ſo advantageouſly Scituated, that no great City in the World can boaſt of more Advantages; as will by and by appear.</p>
               <p>Being examined at the Caſtles, and leave obtained to paſs, we arrived at <hi>Gallipoly,</hi> about 35 Miles from them. This Town was anciently built by one <hi>Callias,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and after his Name called <hi>Callipolis,</hi> but now corruptly <hi>Gallipoly;</hi> it is thinly inhabited by Greeks, who moſtly ſell a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57084:9"/> Liquor called <hi>Raki,</hi> a kind of Brandy, and ſome Oyl. The Doors of their Houſes are not above two Foot high, and ſo made to prevent the proud Turks Inſults, who are hereby prevented riding in on Horſeback. In this Town there is a ſquare Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, with a Tower joyned to it by the Pummel of a Wall; to the Seaward there is an Arſenal, where the old Galleys are laid up which the Turks affirm to have been taken from the Venetians when they took the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> but in Truth they are a part of their own ſhatter'd Fleet that eſcaped from the Battle of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> and were by main ſtrength carried over the Iſthmus of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and put into the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> they not being able to bring them about by Sea, becauſe the Chriſtians had poſſeſſed all the Paſſes.</p>
               <p>After having been a-ſhore, and pretty well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed in this place, we weighed Anchor, and with a Weſt South Weſt Wind paſſed the Iſle of <hi>Marmora:</hi> At this place the Sea is wide, and this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the <hi>Propontis,</hi> though now called moſtly <hi>Mare de Marmora;</hi> and here though we had a fair Wind, the Current ſetting ſtrong againſt us, we could not make much way; however, Sailing on we in a little time came in ſight of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which is about 125 Miles from <hi>Gallipoly,</hi> and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Streight of it we had a very fine Proſpect of that Famous City; it is ſeated in <hi>Thrace,</hi> on <hi>Europe</hi> ſide, over-againſt the Scituation of Ancient <hi>Chalcedon</hi> on the Aſian Shore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by moſt that have ſeen it, is held to be the beſt Scituated of any City in the World for all manner of conveniency, <hi>viz.</hi> On a point of main Land, jutting out towards the <hi>Thracian Boſpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> ſo little divided from <hi>Aſia,</hi> that it requires but half an hours Sailing to paſs thither; on the Right Hand is has the <hi>Propontis,</hi> or <hi>White-Sea;</hi> on the Left the <hi>Euxine</hi> or <hi>Black-Sea</hi> and <hi>Paulus Maeotis,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a great number of Rivers, and having on it many bordering People, this City is plentifully furniſhed with all neceſſaries; for let the Wind
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57084:10"/> blow as it will, the Channels of the White and Black Sea ſerve it, becauſe, when it is contrary to the one it ſtands fair fro the other.</p>
               <p>Between theſe Seas is the entry of the Port, which Nature without the help of Art has made exceeding uſeful, for it is always ſo replenniſhed with Water, that Ships of good burthen may lay their heads on the Keys, and one may ſtep a-ſhore without any difficulty.</p>
               <p>It is held to be firſt Founded by <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> King of <hi>Sparto,</hi> who named it <hi>Byzantium;</hi> and upon his conſulting the Oracle where to build a City, he gave no other Anſwer but this, <hi>viz.</hi> Over-againſt the blind Men, intimating the <hi>Calcidonians,</hi> who had neglected the fair opportunity of a ſight ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated by Nature, and built <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi> oppoſite to it. It was deſtroyed by <hi>Severus,</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Citizens for their Revolt, but reſtored more Magnificent by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, who named it <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> equalling it with <hi>Rome</hi> in her Ancient Glory, and removing the Seat of the Empire thither, as if it were deſigned by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its Scituation, to bear Rule, and be the Miſtriſs of Cities. There goes a Fame, that when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was about to meaſure out ground to build an Imperial City in <hi>Aſia,</hi> a ſtooping Eagle catched up the Line, and carrying it over the Streight, dropt it in the place where the City now ſtands, which was looked on as a fortunate Preſage, and prov'd a ſufficient encouragement for erecting it. It was once taken by the <hi>Latins</hi> from the <hi>Greeks, Anno</hi> 1203, and re-taken by them <hi>Anno</hi> 1254; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second Emperour of the Turks, <hi>Anno</hi> 1453, who ſince made it the Seat of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and called it <hi>Iſtambol,</hi> corruptly from the Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The heat of the Air in Summer is cool, and much allayed by the Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes that come from the Seas. It has been much ſubject to Earthquakes, and is very often ſo to the Plague.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57084:10"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is in Figure Triangular, two ſides of it are waſhed by the Sea, the one by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis, or White Sea, and the other by the Port; the other ſide is towards the Land; the biggeſt of the three is that beaten by the Surges of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis, reaching from the Seraglio to the ſeven Towers, and that towards the Port is the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: The Seraglio being built on the point of the point of the Triangle, gives a curious Proſpect, for it runs out between the Propontis and the Port: Its Gardens on the Shoar are very Charming, there being nothing that is ſcarce and rare but is found in them; and this is held to be the particular ſpot where the Ancient <hi>Byzantium</hi> ſtood. On the other Angle pointing to the Canal of the White Sea, are the ſeven Towers; they were built by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and are covered with Lead; the chief uſe they are now put to, is to keep the vaſt Treaſure of the Empire, ſent as Tribute from many Nations, though part of them are often made a Priſon for Perſons of Quality, and great Officers. At the third Angle which is at the bottom of the Port to the Land ſide, appear the Ruins of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, by which it ſeems to have been very Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent.</p>
               <p>This great City is encompaſſed by ſtrong Walls, and to the Land ſide they are double; in ſome places the Walls are of rough Stone and Brick, in others of Smooth Freeſtoone; they are guarded by a good Ditch, Wharfed and Faced on both ſides; the Walls are guarded by a great number of little Towers at an equal diſtance, and Guns planted commodiouſly, though I confeſs, I take it not to be very ſtrong, compared with the Modern Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Towns and Cities: Some allow it to be 16 Miles in circuit, but I cannot well agree with them, for I, with another Perſon, walked and rowed it at a pretty moderate pace in three Hours, ſo that I gueſs it to be about 12 Miles in Circuit. It has 22 Gates, 6 towards the Land, 5 towards the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis, and 11 along the Port; thoſe to the Water
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57084:11"/> anſwered by Creeks, Landing places and Stairs. When I had made this obſervation I thought it convenient to enter the City, which I did on the fifth of <hi>June</hi> about nine in the Morning, I found the Streets moſtly narrow, the Houſes generally built of Timber, and that is the reaſon when Fires happen, which they often do, vaſt numbers of Houſes are conſumed before the raging Element can be overcome, and the Janiſaries and others, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to extinguiſh it, many times on a diſguſt, or for the ſake of Plunder, encourage the progreſs of the Conflagration by hindering thoſe that would aſſiſt them.</p>
               <p>Going to the Beſeſtn which is a diſtinct Canton of the City, encloſed with Gates and Walls, I found it to be very fine, for here the Merchants keep Shop, and the place is very Regular, the Houſes are covered above with Planks joyned upon Rafters, though there are holes left to let in the Light; and here the richeſt Wares are vended, or at leaſt Samples to be ſeen of ſuch as they have in their Warehouſes; They are all ranked by themſelves, ſo that buſineſs is quickly diſpatched. At ten every Evening the Gates are ſhut, and after that hour none can paſs without giving a ſmall matter of Money to the Porter, and this is the place moſt frequented; greateſt part of the Streets though the City are very Populous, being eaſie to paſs without Crouds at any time.</p>
               <p>From this place I went to viſit the Hypyodrome, which ſpacious place was built by the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> for Tilts, Tournaments, and other exerciſe on Horſeback, and the Turks at preſent call it the place of Horſes; It is 400 paces long, and about 200 broad; and at the end oppoſite to the Seraglio, there are two Obilisks, the firſt is 70 Foot high, and can be diſcerned to conſiſt of no more than one Stone; it is adorned with ſeveral Herogliphical Figures in Relief, placed on a ſquare Marble Pedeſtal; on one of the Faces of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal is an old Latin Inſcription ſo defaced by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57084:11"/> time, that no more can be gathered from it, than that it was built by the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius;</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond has a like in Greek Characters; the Third is adorned with the Emperor's Effigies ſeated on a Throne, with his Officers of State about him; and on the Fourth is repreſented a Battle. The other Obelisk is of Free Stone, ſharp pointed like a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid, and being much worn by time, has no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription on it to be diſcerned.</p>
               <p>Near theſe ſtands a Brazen Piller of conſiderable heighth, commonly called the Serpentine Column, becauſe it appears like three Serpents wreathed or twiſted together, their Tails faſtned to the ground, and at the top it has 3 gapeing Mouths; and it is the common opinion, that this Pillar was ſet up in remembrance of 3 Serpents, who in Ancient times waſted the confines of the City, till the Emperor <hi>Leo Haurus</hi> by Magick Art drew them into a great Ditch in the middle of the Hypyodrome, who were killed by filling up the Ditch with Stones and Earth. In this City there are two other Columns, one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Hiſtorical, and the other the Burnt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, the latter being defaced by Fire, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them being much remarkable, I paſs them over, yet adjoyning to them there is a Court where the Archers Exerciſe, and the Turks are very exact in ſhooting, for I ſee them ſtick their Arrows one after another in the circumference of half a Crown, at 100 Paces.</p>
               <p>The next thing of Note my curioſity led me to viſit was, <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> the principal Moſque in the City; it has ſeveral Doors that lead into a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico that gives entrance into the Moſque, which is 120 Paces in Length, and 80 in breadth, having ſquare Walls, but the Vault or Roof is round, ſo Artificially contrived, that the Frame is ſupported without Columns, though there are many rows of Columns, which only appear to ſupport the weight of two Galleries, yet are placed ſo that they prove very Ornamental, being 30 on each ſide, about 16 Foot high, of hard polliſhed Stone; however, the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57084:12"/> length of Time has made many Clefts and Chinks in them. The Vault of the Moſque retains much of its Ancient Beauty, as being adorned with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Moſaick Work, conſiſting of ſmall guilt Stones ſo neatly joyned, that they after ſo many Ages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main almoſt perfect; and at the four Corners where the Vault begins, in Moſaick Work, are the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gires of the four Beaſts mentioned in the Apocalyps, yet Turks who pretend to abhor Images have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what defaced them, as they have the Figure of our Saviour, which is over the Principal Door: He is repreſented ſitting on a Throne, giving Benedict-to one that proſtrates before him; the Figure of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> appears on the Right Hand; and in a Baſs Relief the Holy Ghoſt is repreſented in the Figure of a Dove, which they have not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced.</p>
               <p>There is to be ſeen the Tomb of the Renowned Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in this ſtately Structure, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times a Chriſtian Church; it is a Grey Stone, 8 Foot long, and 4 over, and the Turks hold it in remembrance of that worthy Emperor of great Eſteem. This Moſque or Temple is paved with curious Marble covered with Mats, to abate the coldneſs of the Stone when they proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the Turks are ſo devoutly ſuperſtitious, that they put of their Barbouches, or Shooes, when they enter their Moſques. There are alſo to be ſeen the ruins of other fine Paintings and Images, partly defaced by the Turks, and partly by Time.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians are not admitted here without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance or Bribery, and thoſe only by the <hi>Franks;</hi> for if a Jew or Greek be found in the Moſque, he muſt either die, or turn Turk. It was built by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi> the Emperor on recovery of his health, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vowed in his Sickneſs, if God ſpared him, to found one of the beautifuleſt Churches in the World, to the honour of the Soveraign Wiſdom, for <hi>Sophia</hi> in the Greek ſignifies Wiſdom, and this is the only Ancient Structure of this kind in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi> for though there are many ſtately
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57084:12"/> Moſques in the City, they are of late building, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Sultans and Sultaneſſes, whoſe Names they bear; as that of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, which is very Stately; of <hi>Achmet Mohomet Selim;</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Chadazet</hi> and <hi>Valide,</hi> new and very Beautiful, by the Idea of which laſt you may gueſs at the reſt; it was Founded by the Sultaneſs <hi>Valide,</hi> Mother to <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Fourth, ſeated in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a large ſquare Court, reſembling a vaſt Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, by reaſon of the Arched Roof that environs it like a Portico, and under are divers Fountains with Cocks, where thoſe that are polluted waſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves e'er they enter the Moſque; it has but one Gate, and that is ſurrounded by a Portico of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary heighth, paved with white and black Marble, ſupported by 64 Pillars of Red Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the Platform is adorned with Painting and Figures after the Turkiſh manner. This Portico is covered with many little Domes, and a very large one in the middle higher than the reſt, the whole Structure being very curious Work covered with Lead; there are four Turrets at the four Corners of the Buidling, called Minarets, ſlender, but very high, with Balconies round them, ſtanding like May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles, with Creſſents on the Globes, and winding-Stairs, juſt enough for the Mueſans to creep up with their loud Bawlings to call the People to Prayers, for they have no Bells, where clapping their hands on their Ears, they go round the Turret in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conies, and when they cry their Voices are heard very far. They call in their own Language, which in Engliſh is to this Effect; <hi>God is a great God, give Teſtimony that there is but one God, come yield your ſelves up to his Mercy, and Pray him to forgive you your Sins. God is a great God,</hi> &amp;c. This Moſque is Vaulted and Adorned with a great number of Lamps and Globes of Glaſs, and in the Globes are many curious Devices, as Galleys, the model of Moſques, Trees, Flowers, Cities, and the like. There is a Table at the upper end, where uſually the High Altar ſtands in the Romiſh Churches, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57084:13"/> to this they turn their Faces when they ſay their Prayers, over which is placed the Name of God, Written in Gold Arabick Characters, and over-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that are fixed two Brazen Candleſticks hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wax Tapers of a vaſt bigneſs. The Sultans or Emperors lie Buried in their Moſques, their Tombs being covered with Rich Carpets, which have been laid on <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Tomb at <hi>Mecha;</hi> for they conclude that ſanctifies them, and keeps them from evil Spirits; their rich Turbans are placed at the Head, and if they have been Warlike, their Cimiters, and other Military Atchievements, are fix-on or near them: Divers Alcorans are chained to the Tombs, and there is always one or other that has a Penſion left them by the deceaſed Emperor to Read the Alcoran to the People that come to viſit the Tomb, and to Pray for his Soul. Sultan <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> has two of his Wives placed at his Head, and eleven of his Children round him; and at the head of the Tomb or Coffin is a convenient place where his Prayer-Books are laid up, appearing through a Latten Grate, adorned with Gold and precious Stones. The Keepers of the Turbe, or little Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the Moſque where theſe Bodies lie, are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at certain hours of the day to Pray for the Souls of the deceaſed.</p>
               <p>The Arſenal is at the end of the Port belonging to the City, being a very compact Building; it contains a conſiderable extent of Ground; the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys are laid up there under 120 Arches; the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are not permitted to come into it, but the Turks ſay, there are Arms for 60000 Men, beſides Furniture for Shipping, and in the Baths many thouſand Slaves are ſhut up who lead miſerable Lives. The Captain Baſſa, and all the Officers depending on the Admiralty, have their Apartments, and lodg in the Arſenal, that they may be ever ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Orders about the Naval concerns.</p>
               <p>In this City are many Hans and Kervanſerais, which ſerve moſt for Warehouſes, being ſtrongly built, barred and guarded to prevent Imbezlement.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:57084:13"/>
               <p> The Hans conſiſt of four ſides of building, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing a ſquare Court with a Fountain, the Roof conſiſts of little Domes covered with Lead; and here Foreign Merchants, who bring their Goods to lay up, find entertainment; they only contain two Stories, divided into Rooms, that have no intercourſe one with another, the lower Story conſiſts of Warehouſes for Goods, and the upper divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to little Chambers, where Strangers that are Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers Lodge, but they muſt furniſh themſelves with all neceſſaries, or otherways they muſt want both Furniture and Proviſions.</p>
               <p>The Karvanſerais are built after the ſame faſhion, only the Stone work reaches but to the firſt Story, and the reſt is Wood and Brick, whereas the Hans have entire Stone Walls of a good thickneſs for their better ſecurities againſt Pilferers. They have each of them but one Gate, and in the latter indigent Perſons are permitted to Lodg, from half a Crown to a Crown a Month.</p>
               <p>The next thing of Note in the City is the Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, which Chriſtians and Jews are prohibited to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, except Ambaſſadors, and ſome few Attendance when they have their Audience, and then ſome crowd in with them that are not concerned, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bribe their way, but it is very dangerous for them to paſs any further than the Second Court, and further I could not gain acceſs, though I profered liberally, and the Turks rarely refuſe Money where they can oblige one for it, and therefore I ſhall give a deſcription as far as I could obſerve, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing over according to the beſt information I could get.</p>
               <p>The Seraglio is the Prince's Pallace, but of very irregular building; it is built on a point of Land that juts out into the Sea, as I have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and ſurrounded with Walls of a greyiſh Stone, adorned at top with a Parapet and Battlement, ſuitable to the City Walls; it is near 4 miles in compaſs, but the greateſt part is Gardens; the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cluſters together, like the ancient building of low
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57084:14"/> Caſtles or Fortifications, ſo that on the out ſide they have nothing of Magnificence, except a few guilt Spires and Globes; the chief Entry is near <hi>Sancta So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> and the Gate is like that of the entrance into many Ancient Cities, without either beautiful Architecture, or Ornament; yet the Capigy keep their Court of Guards under it, and carefully watch the entrance.</p>
               <p>Paſſing this Gate it leads into a large Court, where on the right Hand is the Apartment for ſuch as fall ſick in the Seraglio, with matted Sopha's along the Walls, ſo that they are no better lodged then in Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals; on the left Hand is a Magazine for furniſhing 1000 Men, that the Grand Signior's Domeſticks may, upon any ſudden Inſurrection in the City, defend the Palace, and the Perſon of their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; though notwithſtanding this precaution, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them have been depoſed by the Rabble and Soldery, and come by violent Deaths, as their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories make mention at large.</p>
               <p>There being little elſe remarkable in this Court, I paſſed into the Second, fronted with two large Porticoes; on one ſide are the Grand Signior's Kitchens, where they Dreſs for Him, his Women, and ſuch as live at his Charge in the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> and on the other ſide are his Stables, where 100 Horſes may conveniently ſtand, and many Apartments where the Officers Lodg; and this great Court is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on Horſeback by none but the Grand Signior, all others alight at the Gate: It is not ſo big as the firſt, but conſiſts of a Square, extending 200 Paces every way; there is round it a Gallery in the Form of a Cloyſter, ſupported by a great many Marble Pillars, and covered with Lead; and at the back of that there are Domes, ranging from one end of the Court to the other, covered with Lead, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and on the right Hand, where the Kitchins are, the Stables I mentioned being towards the Sea. The Janiſaries draw up in this Court to the right Hand, and the Horſe to the Left; in the middle there is a delicate Fountain, ſhaded with Cypreſs, and Scyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57084:14"/> Trees; and heretofore near this Fountain, the Grand Signiors cauſed the Heads of the Baſſa's, and other great Men of the Court that diſpleaſed them, to be cut off, as a Terror to others; for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is Deſpotical, and the Lives of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are at the diſpoſal of the Prince. On the left Hand, at the end of the Court, is a Hall, where the Divan or Council of State ſits, and on the Right, a Door which gives entry into that, and is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and none but thoſe who have particular Orders can paſs it.</p>
               <p>Very near this Seraglio, within the ſame enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is another building Founded by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and intended a Pallace, but now it is called the <hi>Old Seraglio,</hi> having many additional Buildings, yet not fair on the out ſide, though theſe and the other have coſtly Gildings and Paintings within; the Turks in general having little regard what out ſide ſhow their Houſes make, ſo they appear Sumptuous and Magnificent within. It is ſurrounded with Walls of an unuſual heighth, without any Windows on the out ſide, the better to prevent the Women from being ſeen; and here the Reigning Sultan ſhuts up the Wives of his Predeceſſors, whom he Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters from the World, except he likes any of them himſelf, or pleaſes to beſtow them on the great Men of his Empire, for their ſignal Services; otherwiſe this is a kind of a Nunnery for Life.</p>
               <p>There is yet a Third Apartment, properly called a <hi>Seraglio,</hi> joyning cloſe to that of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, ſo that he can paſs to it by Galleries privately, when he has a mind to divert himſelf there. What more I could gather by ſight at a diſtance is, that this place which is ſo much talked of, as the Pallace of the greateſt Emperor in the World, eſpecially as to largeneſs of Territories, gives but an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Proſpect; and one at a diſtance can form nothing regular in it, it looking like a confuſed Maſs of Building, in Apartments and Domes.</p>
               <p>The Grand Signior has here his Officers, who have a great many under them; moſt part of them
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57084:15"/> are Eunuchs, Blacks of <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> and others, that are moſt comely of their kind; they formerly were only Gelt, but it is ſaid, that Sultan <hi>Solyman,</hi> one day ſeeing a Gelding back a Mare, and perform, as he ſuppoſed, the office of a Stallion, came Home and cauſed them all to be ſmoothed by the Belly, to prevent their dabling with his Women, of which Wound a great number died, and now they make Water through a Silver Pipe, which they put into the orrifice of the Root of their Yard, to prevent polluting themſelves, by ſcattering their Urine on their Veſtments; for then, till they have Abſolution, they think they are unclean, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter; and now they cut off the Genitals of Children they buy, or have as Tribute, upon the Borders of <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia,</hi> and other Negro Countries; and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny die under this uſage, for it is not done till they are 8 or 10 years old, that they may ſee whether they are Docil or Ingenious; yet they have enough to ſerve in all the Seraglio's in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi> for there are others belonging to the Grand Signior, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide thoſe at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and many to the Baſſa's, and Governors of Provinces in divers Countries; and theſe are ſo Jealous, or rather Envious, which makes them to watch over the Women ſo narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they are rarely too cunning for them; they are lodged in a ſeparate Apartment, together; and the ſingle Teſtimony of one of them, againſt the greateſt Subject in the Empire, coſts the party his Life; nay, a bare Sollicitation, or too near a View, without any Act, is ſufficient for a Strangling; as for Example, Sultan <hi>Amurat</hi> uſed a Proſpective Glaſs, to diſcover the Actions of thoſe that were in the City, and by that means, eſpying a Man at a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, with the like Proſpective, taking a view of one of his Sultana's, walking in the Garden of the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> he thereupon ſent a Capigi, with 4 Mutes, who entered the Houſe, and immediately Strangled the over curious unfortunate.</p>
               <p>Theſe Eunuchs have, in a manner, the ſole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> but particularly of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57084:15"/> Women; and when the Sultana's take the Air in the Garden, the Boſtangis, or Gardeners, ſtand round the Walls, holding Staves with long and broad pieces of Cloth faſtned to them, which makes them as though they were Blind, and is much higher than the Garden Wall, to which their Backs are turned, it being Death to look, if any of the Eunuchs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve it, and complain of it; and this Jealouſie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds ſo far, that no Boat is ſuffered to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 400 Paces of the Garden-Wall, though it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high, if the Sultana's be walking there; and if any perſume it, there are Sentinels advantageouſly placed, to Fire at them; ſo that thoſe who have buſineſs by Water, are conſtrained to fetch a great compaſs about. But, notwithſtanding this Jealouſie, which, in a great or leſs Degree reigns all over the Empire, the Turks eſteem Women as very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Creatures, without Souls, denying that they go to Heaven; That they were only made to ſerve for the uſe of Man, and be obedient to him, and their main end was deſigned for Generation; otherwiſe, unleſs to ſatisfie their Luſts, they eſteem them ſcarce Rational, and little better then Beaſts: In a word, theſe of Quality are but ſplendid Slaves, and the meaner ſort miſerable ones.</p>
               <p>The Eunuchs have the Charge of bringing up the Grand Signior's Pages, called <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>glians,</hi> who are the beautifuleſt Youths that can be got, and for the moſt part of Chriſtian Extraction, but taken ſo young from their Parents, that they eaſily Educate them in the Mahometan Superſtition with great care, till they are about 28 years of Age, and are taught ſuch Arts, and uſed to ſuch Exerciſe as their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation chiefly leads them to. If they are of good natural parts, and prompt in underſtanding, they uſually riſe to the greateſt preferments in the Ottoman Empire; if not, they are turned out, and entered into pay and employments of other natures, living but meanly; but whilſt they live in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> the greateſt Preferment they can, riſe to, is to be of the number of the Forty, who are neareſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57084:16"/> the Grand Signior's Perſon, and theſe the Eunuchs look narrowly after leaſt they ſlip among the Women, or defile one another by unnatural Luſt, for theſe are not diſ membred; among the 40 mentioned, there are four in high Eſteem, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Selihtar</hi> or <hi>Sword-bearer;</hi> the <hi>Tſchoader,</hi> who carries the Cock; the <hi>Ibrictar,</hi> who carries Water ready to pour on the Grand Signior's Hands when he requires it; and the <hi>Kuptar,</hi> who carries the Pot of Sorbet to give him when he calls for it. There are Seminaries of theſe <hi>Ichnogleans,</hi> as at <hi>Peza, &amp;c.</hi> where they are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated, and growing up, ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to be entertained in the Grand <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next that make a conſiderable Figure in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> are the Boſtangis or Gardeners, over whom is a Baſſa, called the <hi>Boſtangi</hi> Baſſa; he has his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and the Priviledge of wearing his Beard, not any beſide him and the Grand Signior doing it, the reſt being Shaved in token of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; He is very great with the Prince, and always ſteers his Barge when he goes to take the Air on the Sea, ſo that having his Ear, and liberty to Diſcourſe with him, all the Grandees ſtand in fear of him, and much conſider his Power, labouring to keep him their Friend; and when any conſiderable Perſon is put to Death in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he is ſent to fetch his Head.</p>
               <p>There are in this City many little <hi>Seraglioes</hi> belonging to the great Men of the Court, but on the out-ſide, they look much like old decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Buildings, and ſome hold, that they built them without external Beauty and Ornament, becauſe the Grand Signior ſhould not be Jealous of their Pride, as aſpiring to too much greatneſs, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is otherways, for they have lovely Apartments, adorned with Gold and Azure; the Floors are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Rich Carpets, ſo that thoſe who enter pull of their Shooes, to prevent any injury they may do them; the Walls of moſt of them are faced with poliſhed Tiles, like <hi>China</hi> Ware; in their Halls, and Chambers, they have riſings about a Foot,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57084:16"/> which they call Divans, covered with richer Carpets than the Floor, and Imbrodered Cuſhions placed in order on them. Here they Reſt, receive Viſits, and ſpend the beſt part of the Day, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Apartments in all theſe, are ſeparated from thoſe of the Lodgings; none but the Maſter of the Houſe, and ſome Eunuchs, are ſuffered to enter where they are; the Women ſtir little abroad, having Baths in their Houſes, with ſuitable Attendance, and other convenient Neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>Thus having deſcribed all that is worthy of Note in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak ſomething of the Neighbouring places, which may properly be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Suburbs of this great City; and in the firſt place <hi>Galata</hi> is a very pleaſant place, ſeparated from the City only by the <hi>Port,</hi> which may be croſſed in Caiques, or Wherries, who are always attending; however, taking a compaſs you may go by Land, and have a very fine Proſpect of the Country. This Town is pretty Large, and formerly belonged to the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> and then was more conſiderable, for it held out ſome time againſt the whole Power of the Ottoman's, after <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Second had taken <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> the Houſes are Fair, and well Built, moſtly Inhabited by <hi>Greeks,</hi> though it is the uſual Reſidence of <hi>Franks,</hi> and they have five Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries there, which much Beautifie the place; and near the Sea ſide, there is the fineſt Fiſh-Market that may be ſeen in any Country, for the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger's-ſhops are ſtocked with ſuch numbers of various kinds of Fiſh, on Market days, that Strangers admire how they ſhould procure them; the <hi>Greeks</hi> keep many Taverns here, ſo that there are frequent diſorders, by reaſon of drunken Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though great care is taken to prevent it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pera,</hi> and <hi>Tophana</hi> are two other pleaſant little Towns; the Former is appointed for the Reſidence of moſt Ambaſſadors; thoſe of the Emperor of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and Republick of <hi>Ragouſa,</hi> having uſually their Reſidence in <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> the French Ambaſſador's Houſe is here, very ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57084:17"/> having a curious Proſpect of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> The latter is the place where they caſt their great Guns, and that in the Turkiſh Language ſeems to give it its Name; the Houſes in both are very finely Built, riſing and falling pleaſantly, ſo that at a diſtance, they ſeem to repreſent a kind of an Amphitheatre.</p>
               <p>To theſe I might add <hi>Caſſumpaſha,</hi> which lies firſt if one goes by Land, and appears like a great Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; her Galleys and Ships are Built and laid up with great conveniency, for it is accommodated with 120 Arched Docks, or Houſes; in the way to this the Ocmeidan, or Field of Arrows, a very ſpacious place, where the Turks exerciſe ſhooting with the Bow; and many reſort thither to pray for ſucceſs on their Arms, and any thing they ſtand in need of.</p>
               <p>One may go in a Caique from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Schudaret,</hi> which the Turks call <hi>Iſcodar,</hi> it being but a good Mile. In the way there is a Tower built on a Rock in the Sea pretty ſtrong, the Guns command the Port, and the Mouths of the <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Black-Sea;</hi> the latter is ſo called, not becauſe the Water is Black, as ſome imagine, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the many caſualties that happen upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſudden Storms, that caſt Veſſels away, to the loſs of many Lives; and beſide, it not being very broad, there are ſeveral Currants cauſed by the <hi>Danube, Boriſtenhes, Tunais,</hi> and other ſmaller Rivers, that diſcharge their Waters into it, and occaſion many Eddies that drive Ships on the Rocks, where they are lodged or ſplit; but to return,</p>
               <p>In the Tower I mentioned, is a fine Well of freſh Water, and ſome call it <hi>Leander</hi>'s Tower, but for what reaſon I know not. <hi>Schudaret</hi> is a pleaſant Village on the <hi>Aſian</hi> Shoar; The Grand Signior has a ſtately <hi>Seraglio</hi> in it, beautified with lovely Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; and a little lower, on the ſame ſide, ſtands <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> anciently very Famous, and Celebrated by the four General Councils held there; yet time has laid the Structures of Antiquity in Ruins, ſo that at preſent it is but an inconſiderable Village,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57084:17"/> which ſtands like the Ruins of <hi>Troy,</hi> as a Memorial there was once ſo famed a place. In another walk of four Hours from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> is the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Iſle, a very pleaſant place to take the Air in, for though it is not great, it contains two little Towns, inhabited by <hi>Greeks.</hi> The Coaſt of the <hi>Black Sea</hi> is alſo a curious place to take the Air upon. This is the <hi>Thracian Boſphorus,</hi> which coming from the <hi>Black Sea</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> mingles its Waters with the <hi>White Sea,</hi> and is but a Mile over at the broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place, no more than 12 Miles in length, and all about this Channel are a great many lovely Houſes and Gardens, ſo that paſſing it, one would conclude it the lovelieſt Proſpect in the World; the Fruits are here Plentiful, and very Excellent; on the <hi>Aſian</hi> ſide there is a pretty Caſtle, where Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was hid 20 Years, when Sultan <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murat</hi> put his other Brothers to Death; and along the Shoar are other Villages, in which one may be furniſhed with what is needful.</p>
               <p>In this Channel they take great quantities of good Fiſh of divers Sorts, and amongſt them the <hi>Sword Fiſh,</hi> ſo called, becauſe it has a long broad Bone on the Snout of it, like a Sword, or rather jaged like a Saw on the edges; there are ſtore of Dolphins, uſually playing about the Boats, as alſo many other curious varieties; ſo that I may conclude, <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Towns adjacent, to be exceeding pleaſantly Scituated, which having thus ſufficiently deſcribed, I now paſs to other uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Obſervations, during my ſtay in the Chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57084:19"/> with Silk and Gold, wherein are lively repreſented the Wars of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors; the Chamber he lodges in is adorned with rich Painting, Gilding, and precious Stones, that caſt a very glorious light in the Night: Six Pages do him Service in his Chamber by Night, watching his Perſon, two and two, by turns, with lighted Torches, the one ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Head, and the other at the Feet of his Bed: When he attires himſelf, they put into his Pocket 1000 Aſpers, and 20 Ducats of Gold, and all that remains not given away that day, they have, when he puts of his Cloaths, for their Fees, for he rarely puts on one Aparrel twice; and when he goes a Hunting, or to divert himſelf, his Purſe-Bearer carries great ſtore of Treaſure to diſtribute; and vaſt quantities of all ſorts of Proviſions follow him, though many times they are not made uſe of.</p>
               <p>The Chief Officers of the Empire are, 1. The Grand Viſier, who acts immediately under the Grand Signior, and by him he ſpeaks to ſuch as have important buſineſs; for no Ambaſſador is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Grand Signior's preſence, but on his firſt Arrival, when he delivers his Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and Preſent, for particularly without the latter, none can have Audience; all other Audiences are had of the Viſier, who is likewiſe called the <hi>Capi-Aga;</hi> he has power of Life and Death, is General of the Army when the Grand Signior is not in the Field, and all take their Directions from him. 2. The <hi>Caſnader</hi> Baſſa is next in Rank, as to Secular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; his Office is to take an Account of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury. 3. The <hi>Chilergy</hi> Baſſa, or Cup-Bearer. 4. The <hi>Seragli Agaſi,</hi> Steward, or Maſter of the Houſhold. 5. The <hi>Chiller Agaſi,</hi> or <hi>Serinder</hi> Baſſa, overſeer of the Seraglio of Women, who is always an Eunuch. 6. The <hi>Boſtangi</hi> Baſſa, or Chief Gardener, of who is already ſpoken. 7. The <hi>Caimacan</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Grand Signior has always near him, ſix Mutes Men, very luſty in Body, that are born Deaf, and conſequently are Dumb. Theſe are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bloody and Cruel, being the Miniſtets of his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57084:19"/> Vengeance, to Strangle whom he pleaſes; and when any one is Strangled in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are thrown out of a particular Window appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that purpoſe into the Sea, and as many Guns are fired, to give Notice, in terror to others, as there are Strangled Bodies thrown out. There are in all 40 of theſe Mutes, ſome of which he keeps as his Buffoons, to play with for his paſtime.</p>
               <p>He has 8 Lance-bearers, called <hi>Mutafurach,</hi> who attend him with Launces, when he goes abroad, and theſe are ſubject to no Command but his own. The Eunuchs of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> I have mentioned elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; the <hi>Turks</hi> call them <hi>Hundurni,</hi> and under their Care, there are conſtantly 500 Virgins, moſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> the choiceſt Beauties that can be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; they are taken from their Parents under 8 Years, and are brought up to Work in the <hi>Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> as in a Nunnery; and when the Grand Signior is deſirous to enjoy any of them, the day before he gives notice to the Chief of the Eunuchs, who Commands the reſt to ſet them in order in their beſt Attire; then the Grand Signior, attended by him, walks between them, as they ſtand in Rows on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, expoſing all their Beauties and winning Allurements to tempt him, and where he likes, he drops his Handkerchief, of which he has choice hanging at his Girdle, which the Eunuch takes up, delivers to the Virgin, and immediately putting her into a Coach, carries her to Rich Lodgings, where ſhe is gorgouſly attired, and ſo he does by all that are this way choſen, and there they remain till they are ſent for in order, by the Grand Signior to his Bed, for he never Marries, but when one is brought to his Bed ſide; he gives her a Golden Head tire, and 10000 Aſpers, cauſing her to live a part, and daily encreaſing her Maintenance, and then ſhe is called a Sultana or Sultaneſs, and the eldeſt Son, if he out-lives his Father ſucceeds to the Throne, and puts all his other Brothers (if they fall into his Hands) to Death, cauſing them to be Strangled with a Bow ſtring; for it is held unlawful to ſhed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57084:20"/> the Sacred <hi>Ottoman</hi> Blood, as they call it, on the Ground, though the Sultanas, and great Men of the Court hide ſome of them, till the Fury is over, and preſerve their Lives, as it has three or four times happened; and this cruel Policy they uſe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the diſmembring the Empire by Civil broils, and the better to ſecure the Throne to themſelves.</p>
               <p>There are about 300 Perſons called <hi>Sollacchi,</hi> who continually march near the Grand Signior's Perſon, and are as it were his Guard; and theſe are under the Command of the Aga of the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. They are attired in Linnen Garments, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down beneath their Knees, and over them they ware quilted Waſtcoats, with half Sleeves of Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faty, Damask, or Sattin; and on their Heads a Cap and Feather, carrying Bows and Arrows. There are another kind of Footmen, called <hi>Peichi,</hi> exceeding ſwift in running, and theſe are employed in the nature of Lackeys, or Foot-Poſts, and are attired in Cloth of Gold, with a Girdle of the ſame; the Caps are in faſhion of our Butter pots, with a Silver Pike ſtanding out before in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Horn.</p>
               <p>There are 4000 Porters that give attendance in the Court, the Chief of them is the <hi>Capigi</hi> Baſſa.</p>
               <p>The Judges they call <hi>Cadis,</hi> who are divided into all parts of the Empire, in Cities, or great Towns, to decide Controverſies; yet their Suits, eſpecially between the Turks, are very few, and they make a quick diſpatch of buſineſs, there being rarely Advocates allowed, to Procraſtinate buſineſs; nor do they admit of Evidence in Writing, always ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it by word of Mouth, ſo that Bills Bonds, and other Contracts, are not ſignificant in <hi>Turkey;</hi> yet there is much Bribery uſed, and he that can give the Judge moſt, uſually carries the Cauſe. They puniſh Crimes with great ſeverity, and ſo ſpeedily, that rarely Thefts are committed by any private Turk, and the People in all Cities are careful to prevent Murthers, for if the Murtherer eſcape, a great ſum of Money is required of the Perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57084:20"/> whoſe Door the Murthered Body is found, which is exacted with Rigor.</p>
               <p>The Divan conſiſts of the Grand Viſier, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Viſiers of the Bench, and there the important buſineſs of State is Controverted, and Cauſes heard; of all which the Grand Viſier gives the Grand Signior an account; nor dares he diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or hide any thing, as knowing the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior has a Window into it, before which hangs a thin Curtain, through which he can ſee and hear, but not be ſeen, and therefore the Viſiers know not but he may be always there in the Divan time, which keeps ſuch an awe over them, that they do better Juſtice than in other places, to prevent their Heads flying off, as it ſometimes has happen'd, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leaſt defect or partiality. Next to the Baſſas, the Beglerbegs, or Lords of Lords, are in higheſt Authority in Temporal matters; they have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over Provinces and Armies, and under them are divers <hi>Zanzacks,</hi> as their Deputies; but their Government is during the Prince's pleaſure; and the Chief of theſe is the Beglerbeg of <hi>Rormania</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> under whoſe Command are 21 Zanzacks. Theſe uſually exerciſe and bring to the Field the Spahi and Tiraarcots, the <hi>Turks</hi> beſt Horſemen: Theſe latter are certain Horſemen, uſually on the Frontiers, that for Lands alotted them out of the Grands Signior's Conqueſts, are bound to give their attendance, and ſerve in the Wars upon Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. The Spahi are moſt <hi>Europeans,</hi> trained up Young to manage a Horſe, and exerciſe Cavalry, having Pay. There are alſo <hi>Spachoglanians, Silicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> and <hi>Olofagians,</hi> who have Lands or Penſions aſſigned them to ſerve in the Wars; for none, as in other Countries, can purchaſe Lands for Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the whole Empire being in Fee-ſimple the Grand Signior's, and all things revokable at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Horſemen march under a white Banner, moſtly Armed with ſtrong Coats, Bows, Arrows, Fire-Arms, Cimitars, Battle-Axes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57084:21"/> are another ſort of Horſemen, called <hi>Caripices,</hi> but not above 800: Theſe are uſually the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's Guard, ſurrounding him in the middle of the Batallion of the Janiſaries, and are Fellows ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, that they will venture on any Enterpriſe; being for the moſt part Sons of great Commanders, trained up from their Youth in this way.</p>
               <p>The Janiſaries are the <hi>Turk's</hi> beſt Footmen; and theſe at firſt are taken when Children from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, moſtly Chriſtians, but brought up in the Mahometan Superſtition; inured to all manner of hardſhip, and have Officers over them, to teach them the uſe of Arms; and theſe encloſe the Grand Signior when he marches with the Army: They ware white Caps; their Arms are Harquibuſes, and ſharp cutting Cimitars, who ſince their firſt Inſtitution, as a Nurſery of Soldery, have been the chief ſupport of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; they are commanded by an Aga, or Chief Commander, to whom nothing is ſo fatal as their Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, for that creats in the Grand Signior a Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of his aſpiring, and on this Account many of the Aga's have loſt their Lives, but moſtly they are put to Death privately, to prevent their being reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued; and if he be a Court Favourite, the Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are diſtruſtful of him, and ſometimes on failure of their Pay, and other Occaſions, Mutiny, and Murther him; ſo that on either hand he ſtands ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tickliſh in his high promotion.</p>
               <p>The Janiſaries in <hi>Conſtantinople, &amp;c.</hi> have great Halls, or Apartments, where they Sleep together, their Beds being placed on either ſide; and all thoſe of a Battallion uſually Dine together, the younger being appointed to ſerve the elder, and if any one abſent himſelf from his Lodging, unleſs upon leave, or ſome particular occaſion, he is ſure to be ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cudgeled, yet obliged, by way of ſubmiſſion to his puniſhment, to Kiſs the Hand that inflicts it.</p>
               <p>In time of Peace their employs are different; ſome are appointed to wait on Ambaſſadors, others on Merchants, and Conſuls, or ſuch as Travel through
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57084:21"/> the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Territories. They have power to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Malefactors, and ſee good Orders kept, being in great Eſteem with all Men: ſo that if they go into the Market to buy any thing, they will have it at their own price, the Vender not gain-ſaying; but this may be concluded to proceed rather from the effects of Fear than Love; and they carry ſuch a Vogue, that no Grand Signior thinks his Throne ſetled, till they approve of him; ſo that to purchaſe their good Opinion, the new Sultan pays off their Arrears, diſtributes Money amongſt them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes their Stipends.</p>
               <p>Though theſe are the Chief Strength of Foot, yet there others, but not ſo ſerviceable, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Acoujces,</hi> which ſerve as a forlorn hope; theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve no Pay, but have liberty to plunder in War time, allowing the Sultan a fifth part of the ſpoil. The Aſapi, which are Rabble, raiſed as there is need for them, and ſerve as Pioneers, being of ſo ſmall account, that they are ſet in the Front of the Battle to receive the firſt ſhock, and tire the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with ſlaughtering them; and when a Town is Beſieged, they are ſet firſt to ſcale the Walls, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe the Beſieged, and their ſlain Bodies ſerve as a Rampart to mount on, or fill up the Ditch; and ſo little are theſe miſerable Creatures eſteemed, that a Spahi having taken five of them in a Civil War, offered them to a Butcher for a Sheep's Head, which he refuſing, the Spahi ſwore if he would not make the exchange, he would cut of their Heads, and boyl them, and was preparing to do it; but the Butcher, though a Man of Blood, ſeeing him in earneſt, gave him the Sheep's Head to ſave the poor Wretches Lives, and afterwards ſet them at liberty.</p>
               <p>The Grand Signior has always 6000 Gunners in Pay, moſt of them Rhenegado Chriſtians, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mahometans, many of them are <hi>French</hi> Men; and theſe are called <hi>Topegi;</hi> Twelve thouſand others are in Pay, to look after his Ammunition; his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are very numerous, and his Train of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57084:22"/> large. There are 3000 attending the Grand Signior's pleaſure, called <hi>Chiaus,</hi> or <hi>Chiaux,</hi> who act in the nature of Serjeants at Arms, and are in good Eſteem, being often employed in Embaſſes; but their chief employ is to carry Letters, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations from the Grand Signior, or Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, and are impowered to apprehend Mallefactors, yet go not to the Wars, unleſs the Grand Signior is there. Theſe are Commanded by a Baſſa of their own order, who is of ſuch Credit, that when he is ſent for any Man's Head, though he has no War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Writing, his Authority is not diſputed.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Armies March, it is with as great ſilence as may be; they are under a regular Diſcipline, and live very ſparing in Diet; for the moſt part, on Rice, dried Fruits, Bread baked in the Aſhes, and powdered Fleſh dried in the Sun, rarely complaning as the Chriſtians do of want, but patiently endure and wait till they can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; no Women are found in their Armies, and the Servants attending on great Men are Liſted, and do the Office of Soldiers in their March; they obſerve the beck of the Hand, or ſhew of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as a Command, and underſtand to obey it; nor dare they in their March, enter into any Corn Field, nor plunder in any friendly Country, as other Soldiers do, under pain of Death, ſo that the People, as with us, are not concerned when great Armies march, as knowing they ſhall loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing if they look to it, that it be not privately ſtolen; and Theft is ſeverely puniſhed amongſt them.</p>
               <p>To ſupport this, and other Charges in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the Grand Signior's Incoms are accounted 20 Millions a Year, moſt of it ariſing from Preſents, Cuſtoms, and Confiſcation; though in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, whole Kingdoms lie in a manner waſt, by reaſon of the vaſt number of Men conſumed in War, or rather, induſtry is diſcouraged; for ſhould they get Wealth by their Labour, it is theirs but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Prince's pleaſure, and none are certain how ſoon he may ſtrip them of all.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:57084:22"/>
               <p> As for the Religion of the Turks, it is no Ancienter than <hi>Mahomet,</hi> an Impoſtor, Born in <hi>Arabia,</hi> who ſet it abroach about the Reign of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, for taking his Tenents from the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Hereſies, denying the Divinity of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, he drew a Multitude after him, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powerful, forced many to follow his Opinion; and ſince it has been carried on by the Sword to ſpread ſo wide. The <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being then moſt prevalent, after dilating with himſelf, he leaned to the firſt, and mixed his own wild Notions with what he took out of the Moſaick Law, and from the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between Clean and Unclean Meats, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; but the latter not performed at the end of 8 Days, as the <hi>Jews</hi> Cuſtom is, but at the end of 8 Years, when the Child is able to make a Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Belief, and ſpeak in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, <hi>viz. There is but one God, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>is his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, one God, and equal Prophets.</hi> At the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, there is Feaſting three Days, for all the Friends and Kinsfolks. The Female Children only ſpeak the Words; yet the Mooriſh Mahometans, in ſome parts, uſe a kind of a Circumciſion to their Females, cutting off a bit of the Nimphae. If any Chriſtian turn Turk, he is led about the Streets, as in Triumph, and receives Preſents and Gifts as he paſſes, to encourage him to perſevere in his new undertaking; but the Men, be they of what Age they will, that ſo renounce their Faith, muſt be Circumciſed, yet the Turks afterward ſet Light by thoſe that Renounce, and will rarely Truſt or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them, ſaying, <hi>They are not worthy to be truſted that Renounce their Faith, be it what it will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Laws is contained in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> wherein among other things, one God, the Maker of the World, and of all Things, is owned. Can the <hi>Turks</hi> Honour Chriſt as a great Prophet, but deny him to be the Son of God? They are forbidden by their Law to Worſhip Images, or to have any ſet up in their Moſques; but their <hi>Alcoran</hi> indulges them in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57084:23"/> Senſuallity, and promiſes them much of Worldly Felicity, or ſuch like pleaſures as we have here, in another World, but obtain'd and carried on with greater Eaſe and Happineſs, for their Paradiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the enjoyment of handſom Women, and ſuch like Trifles, though here they look on them to have no Souls, and ſcarcely Rational Creatures.</p>
               <p>They hold their Sabbath on our Friday, and their Lent laſts 30 days, during which time they neither Eat nor drink in the Day, but take their repaſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sun-ſet; but not till they have Notice by the Voice of Men from the Minarets or Steeples; they alſo abſtain from Women; Wine is forbidden in their Law, yet many times they Carouſe it ſo luſtily in private, that they get Drunk; this Lent they call <hi>Ramadan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>Bairam,</hi> or <hi>Easter,</hi> is continued with great ſhew three Days, but it begins not preciſely at a time, becauſe it muſt commence at the New of the Moon, yet not till ſhe appears; and truſty Perſons are ſent to watch on the Mountains, and high places, to ſee her, and he that firſt diſcovers her has a Reward, and then it begins with Proclamation; they have other publick times, as the little <hi>Bairam, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If during the reading of the Law they look Back, ſcratch their Heads, or do any thing that is unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they think they have loſt the benefit they were to have received at that time; and I muſt confeſs they ſeem to be very preciſe in their Devotions, though generally very Ignorant in Learning; yet of late, ſome of the better ſort put their Children to learn the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue, becauſe the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is Written in it.</p>
               <p>By their Law they have leave to Marry as many Wives as they can maintain, and when any of them proves with Child, the Husband muſt not Carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know her till ſhe is delivered. There is another kind of Marriage Contract during Pleaſure, called <hi>Kebin,</hi> moſtly practiſed by Strangers, who, for a certain Sum, ſignifying their intention to the <hi>Cadi,</hi> who notes down the Contract, may have a Wife
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57084:23"/> for as long as he pleaſes; but when he turns her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, he muſt give her what he bargained for, and keep the Children, if ſhe has any by her. The <hi>Turks</hi> often Divorce their Wives with ſhewing little or no Cauſe, but the Wives have not that Priviledge. They muſt prove before the Judge, that their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands are not able to keep them, or that they have attempted to uſe them againſt the courſe of Nature, and the like. If a <hi>Turk</hi> debauch a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, both of them, upon Conviction, muſt ſuffer Death, unleſs he can perſwade her to change her Faith, and ſo it is with a Chriſtian and a Turkiſh Woman, he muſt turn <hi>Turk,</hi> or be burnt, unleſs by largely Bribing the <hi>Cadi,</hi> he can get it off, which ſometimes happens, if ſhe be of mean Rank.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this liberty to Marry, and take ſo many Wives, the <hi>Turks</hi> are great <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and the Baſſa's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are guilty of keeping handſome Youths, whom they purchaſe as Slaves, to ſatisfie their Brutal Luſts this way, yet they keep it as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate as may be.</p>
               <p>The Chief Interpreter of their Law is the Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, or Arch-Prieſt. The Grand Signior nominates and chuſes him from among the Learned Men in their Law. He is greatly Reverenced by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and termed the Head of their Church, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cider of all Controverſies ariſing in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. All the Baſſa's are ſubject to his Directions, as a Rule to them in their Government. He aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf not to ſet down in the Divan, only he paſſes very ſtately through it, when he is ſent for by the Grand Signior, who riſes at his approach to do him Honour, then places him by him on his Seat, and diſcourſes familiarly with him about matters of Religion, State, or Previous Queſtions; and this Honour is allowed to no other.</p>
               <p>Next to the Mufti, in this ſort of Dignity, are the Cadile-Squires, Taliſmen, or two Doctors of the Law, whoſe buſineſs it is to examine the Cadi's, or Judges, diſperſed in the Provinces of the Empire; and theſe for the moſt part are attendant on the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57084:24"/> Grand Signior. One has Juriſdiction over the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> Cadi's, and the other over the reſt, and are Sovereign Judges within their own Juriſdiction, in all cauſes about matters of Religion, and are, as it were, Patriarchs. Theſe are of great Authority, having places in the Divan, and in the Council of Baſſa's, where they are conſulted in the weighty Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Empire.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>The Belief of the</hi> Turks, <hi>and many other things practiſed among them; as their Charity, Mourning at Funerals, Games, Juſt Obſervances,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Turks</hi> believe that after any Perſon is Dead and layed in the Grave, the Angels come to examine them, and that they have Angels to guard them in their Life time, every one being appointed to a particular Member; and when they take up any piece of Paper in the Street, leaſt the Name of God ſhould be writ on it, they will not take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them, for fear of putting it to prophane Uſes, but ſtick it on the next Wall, ſo that the Cranies are often found ſtuck full of them; yet they will Swear by the Name of God, but it is to what is Truth, for otherways they are looked on as Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious, and Infidels. As to their Belief, they hold that divers Beaſts go to Paradiſe, as the Camel of <hi>Selch:</hi> (one of their Prophets) the Ram of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> offered up in Sacrifice; the Cow of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe Aſhes was mingled with the Water of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which ſeems to be the Golden Calf in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb; Solomon</hi>'s Ant; the Parrot of the Queen of <hi>Sheba.</hi> They alſo believe <hi>Jonas's</hi> Whale that caſt him on dry Land, and <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Aſs ſhall be there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; four Sleepers, and a little Dog, who led them to a Cave in time of Perſecution, where they ſlept 300 Years, which ſeemed to them but as one Night, for one of them going to buy Victuals when they awaked with Antiquated Money, the time was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the Date of the Coin. They hold in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> according to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s promiſe, that they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57084:25"/> ſhall enjoy Virgins, freſh Coloured, with large Black Eyes, and Beautiful Boys attending them; who at firſt ſhall be but Fifteen, and never exceed Thirty Years of Age, always in a Bloom or Spring of Beauty; and that God ſhall appear to them every Friday, which is their Sabbath; that there they ſhall have Rivers, pleaſant Fields, Gardens, and the like. They ſay thoſe in Hell ſhall Drink ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water, and Eat of the Fruit of a Tree called <hi>Zacon,</hi> which grows out of the bottom of Hell, and riſes to a great heighth, the Branches of it being like the Heads of Devils; and if thoſe that are in Hell have a little Faith, after they are purged by Fire, to conſume their Sins, they ſhall be waſhed in a Water called <hi>Selzaboul,</hi> and then admitted into Paradiſe; but thoſe that have not Faith when they are conſumed to Aſhes, ſhall be Created a new, and ſo prepared Eternally to endure the Torments; they hold a kind of Purgatory, but they ſay there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny back Doors, by which they may give the Devil the ſlip, if they are watchful and cunning. They Pray for the Dead, and invocate a ſort of Saints of their own making.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have many Fountains, and in waſhing they think they are free from Defilements, even after having lain with their Wives, Noctural Pollutions, their Urin dropping on their Garments, or touch-a Dog, and indeed in any other matters that they conceive they are Polluted; and they are ſo Nice in it, that upon Travelling, they will go a great way to ſeek Water, and if they find none, to do it with Sand; and indeed they keep their Bodies in all parts extream cleanly, even to Superſtition, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rights and Ceremonies they uſe, as the Abdeſt and Gouſt.</p>
               <p>The ſober <hi>Turks</hi> are very Charitable to Men and Beaſts, doing all they can to relieve them in their Neceſſities, ſo that they ſupply the Poor for the moſt part, without putting any to the Shame of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Streets to Beg; ſome of them when they die, leave Penſions to maintain Beaſts, to keep them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57084:25"/> their Natural Lives; and in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I ſaw a Bitch who had got into a Corner to caſt her Whelps; the <hi>Turks</hi> no ſooner ſaw it, but they made a Wall with Bricks and Stones about her, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral run and fetched Victuals, and other Neceſſaries, which in a wonderful manner ſhewed their compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards the poor Creature, nor did one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leave attending her, till the Puppies were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her, and ſhe capable of ſhifting for her ſelf.</p>
               <p>Images, as I have already hinted, are prohibited amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> but they are very deſirous of curious Paintings, though they are not Artiſts at it. There is a prohibition of Uſury by their Alcoran, though it is connivingly done by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> practice it frequently. Swines Fleſh is counted unclean among them, and ſome <hi>Turks</hi> would rather die than Eat it; nor dare the Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers uſe Hog's Briſtles in ſowing their Shooes, if it ſhould be known, they would be puniſhed. When a <hi>Turk</hi> dies, there is great Mourning; the greater the Quality, the more the Women fall a howling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, and thoſe that cannot frame themſelves to it, hire thoſe that are accuſtomed to it, and as often as any Viſitants come, the Lamentation is renewed, and when the Corps is in the Grave, they go often thither to Weep, the Widow expreſſing what good things her deceaſed Husband has done for her; they often ſpread Carpets with Victuals, that thoſe that paſs by may Eat it, and Pray for the Soul of the deceaſed. They ſet at the Head of the Grave a Stone, which they ſay, the Angel that is to examine him ſits on; and they bid the Dead Perſon anſwer him ſtoutly, and not be afraid. They burn Incenſe about the Graves, as they ſay, to ſcare away the Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Pray to God to be merciful to the Party; and according to his Quality, he has a Turban placed at the Head of the Grave, or Tomb, by which he is diſtinguiſhed, as to his Rank.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Turks</hi> in general, they are well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſtrong in Body; and the Women are moſtly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57084:26"/> Handſom, their Complexion Fair, becauſe they ſeldom ſtir abroad, unleſs the Vulgar Sort. The Habit of Men and Women is very neat and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, keeping ſtill in one Faſhion. They are People of a Jolley temper, and much rely on Fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, every one concluding there is a ſet time for all Accidents, and none believe they ſhall die before the appointed Hour, which in War makes them run upon deſperate attempts, for they are verily perſwaded, they may as well die in their Beds as in the Field at the ſame time; and if it is ſo decreed, their Fate is irreſiſtable. They are in Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Prince, and ſubmit to his Decrees, without reaſoning the Juſtice or Injuſtice of them; they play at divers Games, but never for Money, to avoid Quarrelling; and Deuelling is a thing not known amongſt them. However they are very Proud, and eſteem all others inferiour to them, thinking themſelves the Valianteſt and Wiſeſt Men on Earth; a conceited Vanity too much indulged amongſt Chriſtians; they are exceeding Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and their Ignorance is the Mother of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, for their Prieſts labour to keep them ſo, that they may not diſcern Truth from Fables.</p>
               <p>As to Weight and Meaſure they are very Juſt, for one may ſend a Child to the Market, and they dare not in the leaſt defraud it; for there are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who overlook thoſe places, and if they diſcover a defraud, the Perſon who does it is Baſtinado'd, and perhaps, unleſs he Compounds, ſeverely fined; and although, as in all Nations, there are ſome Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities committed, yet here a great Caution is uſed to prevent it, though ſometimes Broils hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the Streets, when the <hi>Turks</hi> get Drunk, and Blood is ſhed.</p>
               <p>After all this, they account <hi>Chriſtians</hi> no better than Dogs, and as often, almoſt, as they ſee them in the Streets, put more or leſs Affront upon them, except ſuch as are protected by Janiſaries, or other Authority; they ſwear by their Beards, the Head of their Anceſtors, and that of the Grand Signior,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57084:26"/> which they ſeldom break; for though none within the <hi>Seraglio</hi> but the Grand Signior, and the <hi>Boſtangi</hi> Baſſa, are allowed to ware their Beards, thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out are not limitted.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Turks</hi> are very Devout and Punctual in their Pilgrimages to <hi>Mecha</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> to viſit <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Tomb, and every Year there goes a great Caravan from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as well as from divers other places, which I ſhall mention at the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Chapter, and they ſo time it, that they may be there at the time of their Carnaval. The Grand Signior ſends Rich preſents, as Velvet em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Gold, and <hi>Arabian</hi> Characters in Gold and Silver, Pearl and Rich Stones, for Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, Carpets, Coverings for the Doors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but theſe uſually are ſent from <hi>Cair</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> becauſe it is much nearer to <hi>Mecha</hi> than <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and when the Holy Cammel, as they term it, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries theſe Rich Ornaments paſſes by, there is great crouding to touch the Burthen, and thoſe that do it, kiſs their Fingers, and think themſelves Bleſſed.</p>
               <p>This Caravan amounts moſt times, to between 10 and 20000, and ſometimes a far greater number. I ſhall not trouble the Reader with a Journal of the way, becauſe I Travelled it not; however, it muſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57084:27"/> be very tedious, becauſe it is Long, and over De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts, and rugged Mountains, which makes them take great ſtore of Proviſions with them, and Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to recruit them with Freſh Water, which in the Hot Countries they paſs, is rarely to be found; they moſtly Encamp in the Fields and Deſarts, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conſtrained to ſet Watches, leaſt Robbers ſhould break in on the out skirts of their Camp, to kill and plunder, before the Alarum can be taken; nay, the wild Beaſts near Forreſts aſſault them, and kill Men and Cattle, eſpecially ſuch as ſtraggle too far from the main Body; but for the hardſhips they endure, ſome Priviledges are allowed them, for whatever Crimes they commit lower than Treaſon, if they eſcape, and make this Pilgrimage, upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn they are abſolved, and accounted as Honeſt as if they had never Offended. They have a Guard of Janiſaries, with many others who go Armed, and their number gathers by the way, like a Snow-ball rowled from a ſteep Mountain; they appear all the way very devout, the number conſiſting of Men, Women, and Children; ſome indeed, take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Trade and Commerce, carrying ſtore of rich Wares with them; all the way, thoſe in Pilgrimage Sing Verſes of their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and beſtow Charity according as they are able.</p>
               <p>When they come within two days Journey of <hi>Mecha,</hi> they ſtrip themſelves, only leaving their Privities covered with a Napkin, for it is a Capital Offence, either in Man or Woman, to let them be ſeen, and another Napkin about their Necks, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging this kind of Franſey, to be out of reſpect to the place where their Prophet had ſo often Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled; on their Feet they wear Scandals, ſaying, <hi>The Ground is Holy, and we will not defile it with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Feet:</hi> And in this State they continue 8 Days, during which term, it is not lawful to be Shaved, to Buy or Sell, kill any thing, or be angry with their Servants, nor ſpeak any thing that is unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and if any one Treſpaſſes, he is to attone by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57084:27"/> Alms; thoſe that are Sick are diſpenſed from Strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but they muſt in lieu of it give Alms.</p>
               <p>When they come to <hi>Mecha,</hi> they ſtay there three Days, during which time they viſit the ſeveral places of Devotion. This <hi>Mecha</hi> is an Ancient Town Scituate among the Mountains, built all of Stone and Mortar; and here they hold <hi>Mahomet</hi> was Born, prohibiting all but Muſſelmen to enter it on pain of Death. In the middle of it is the Kiaabe, or Square Houſe; it is ſurrounded with a Wall to hinder approach; they go round it ſeveral times in Devotion, ſaying certain Prayers, an Imum, or Prieſt, goes before them, and what Antick Trick or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures ſoever he ſhews, they imitate him; firſt they walk ſoftly and Mutter their Prayers, then, at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Intervals, they Run and Skip, ſhruging and turning their Shoulders many ways; then they fall into a ſoft pace again, and ſo continue it by turns, till they have ended their Prayers. This Houſe is covered with a Dome, and it has a Well of good Water, conſidering what other places afford about the City, they being moſtly Brackiſh or Bitter; near to the Door, upon the entrance of this Houſe or Temple, is a black Stone, as big as a Pumpion: This the <hi>Turks</hi> ſay, came down from Heaven, and was then White, but Man's Sins polluted it, and made it turn Black; and he that can firſt kiſs it, when they have given one another the <hi>Selam,</hi> after the Prayer of <hi>Kouſchlouk,</hi> on Friday, which falls within three Days that they ſojourn there, is held a Saint, and every one ſtrives to kiſs his Feet; but this ſame proves Fatal to the Party, who is ſmoother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Croud. This Houſe is never entered but four times a Year, and one of them is at the Rama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, to waſh it with Roſe-Water, unleſs any one will give 100 Chequins of Gold for admittance. It is covered all round on the out-ſide with Stuffs ſent by the Grand Signior, in whoſe Dominions it is, and other <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes; and every Year the rich Covering is renewed; the old being cut out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Relicks, and ſold by the Sultan <hi>Scherif,</hi> who

               <p>When the Pilgrims have finiſhed their three days at <hi>Mecha,</hi> they go to <hi>Minnet,</hi> where they are to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the Vigil of the <hi>Little Bairam,</hi> and on the day of <hi>Bairam,</hi> they Sacrifice Sheep, every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Ability, diſtributing part to the Poor; then they ſhave themſelves, and put on their Clothes to viſit Mount <hi>Arafat,</hi> and there they ſtay 3 days more; the firſt Day after they have ſaid Prayers, they go to the Foot of the Hill, throw 7 Stones againſt the Mount, and ſtay there, the next Day they throw 14, and the Third 21: They ſay they throw theſe Stones to break the Devil's Head, who in that place tempted <hi>Abrahain,</hi> when he was going to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his Son <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> for they will not allow it to be <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Here they ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ſought one another for the ſpace of 220 Years, after they were driven out of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> the one going up the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on one ſide, whilſt the other went up on the other ſide, and ſo made it a Fruitleſs ſearch, but at the end of this time met juſt on the top of it. Here the Sultan <hi>Scherif</hi> ſays ſome Prayers, and gives them his Benediction, and ſo this Work is concluded. He has abundance of ways, under the Umbrage of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, to ſqueeze Money out of them, and is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly Rich.</p>
               <p>After this the Pilgrims go to <hi>Medina,</hi> to viſit <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>'s Tomb, which according to Authentick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, does not hang in the Air by Virtue of Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones: It ſtands as other Tombs, and is indeed encompaſſed with Iron Grates, upon a ſuſpition they once had, that 2 Chriſtians, Habited like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes, intended to ſteal it away, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe had dug under it, to get the Body. <hi>Medina</hi> is 3 Days Journey from the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> its Port is called <hi>Jambo.</hi> This and <hi>Mecha</hi> are but indifferent Towns, though of ſuch great Reſort. About the middle of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57084:30"/> 
                  <hi>Medina</hi> is a Moſque, and in a Corner of it ſtands <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Tomb, covered as the Monuments of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperors at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Sepulchre is in a little round Building, or Tower, covered with a Dome, which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Turbe.</hi> The Building is quite open to the middle; up to the Dome, and all round there is a little Gallery, of which the out-ſide Wall has ſeveral Windows with Silver Grates to them, and the inſide Wall of the little Tower adorned with a great number of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, being the place that anſwers to the Head of the Tomb; and this certainly is exceeding Rich, by the Gifts of many Princes, and others, as Diamonds, Gold, Rubies, Saphires, and other ſorts of Jewels, that might, for their Value, purchaſe a petty Kingdom; and lower down, there is a half Moon of Gold of a vaſt Value, by reaſon of the precious Stones which enchaſe it.</p>
               <p>The Turbe, wherein the Tomb is, is hung round with Hangings of Red and White Silk, like Damask, unleſs where the Jewels are, and there they are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſide, that their Luſtre may appear, and round the Hangings are Words in Characters of Gold, expreſſing the Names of GOD, and <hi>Mahomet, &amp;c.</hi> The Door, by which one enters into the Gallery, is Silver, and ſo is that which goes out of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery into the Turbe. The Pilgrims viſit ſome other places hereabouts, but of no great Note, yet one thing more is confirmed on all Hands, to be very remarkable in thoſe dry Countries, <hi>viz.</hi> The next Night after the Pilgrims are gone, ſo much Rain falls, that it ſeems like a Deluge, for a time, and much Fertelizes the Plains, waſhing away all the Blood and Filth of the Sacrifices, and this falls al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Third Night after the Sacrifice at their <hi>Little Beiram,</hi> or <hi>Eaſter,</hi> though this tide generally changes the Day, as with us our <hi>Eaſter</hi> does; and this they look upon as a Miracle, to confirm their Oblations are accepted; and indeed the wiſeſt of Men may be puzzeled, to know, whether ſo exact a falling of Rain, in a Country, parched and dry,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57084:31"/> for the moſt part, proceeds from a Natural, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Many times 100000 People meet at <hi>Mecha</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, encamping on the Plains; as for their going to <hi>Medina,</hi> ſome refuſe it, becauſe they are not bound by their Law, to viſit <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Tomb, but at Pleaſure, and then they muſt ſay a Prayer for his Soul. The other Caravans come from <hi>Aegypt, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Perſia, India,</hi> and <hi>Barbery;</hi> ſo that the Concourſe, according to the Relation I had, is exceeding great.</p>

               <p>From this place I ſet forward to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there by ſeveral Stages, finding nothing in the way memorable. <hi>Smyrna</hi> is about 8 days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of a Caravan from <hi>Burſa;</hi> It is a noted Town of <hi>Jonia;</hi> they ſay it was firſt Founded by <hi>Tantulus,</hi> and ſince called <hi>Smyrna,</hi> by an Amazon of that Name, who Conquered it; it has been ſubject to Earthquakes, and felt the dire effects of them, by being reduced to a heap of Rubbiſh; and after that built by <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> nearer to the Sea than at firſt it ſtood; the People boaſt that <hi>Homer</hi> was Born there; the <hi>Turks</hi> at preſent call it <hi>Iſmyr.</hi> This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Anciently one of the Seven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to whom St. <hi>John</hi> was commanded to Write, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well Peopled, and Defended by a Caſtle, but it is not ſtrong; there is a huge Ciſtern cut out of a Rock, and the Amphitheatre, where St. <hi>Policarp</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Martyrdom. There is another Caſtle nearer the Sea, and on the Gate, the Arms of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuppoſed to be erected by the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> who once were Maſters of the City, and all the Coaſt. This Caſtle ſhuts the Port, which is but little, ſo that the Stranger Trading Ships ride at Anchor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, in the Road, which is good and ſpacious. There is another Caſtle at the Mouth of the Road, commanding the Ships that enter, and go out, for the Cuſtom here is very conſiderable to the Grand
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57084:32"/> Signior, moſt <hi>European</hi> Traders having Conſuls there. The Country about it is Spacious, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and Fruitful; Oyl, and a pleaſant ſort of Wine, called <hi>Smyrna</hi> Wine, in abundance. The Air is Temperate, for in the Heat of Summer the Northern Breezes blow, and cool all the Region a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
               <p>After I had tarried here 8 Days, I found a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel bound for <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> I had read much of that anciently Famed Country, which enticed me to lay hold on the opportunity of being an Eye-Witneſs, of what had been almoſt every where ſpoke of it, ſo embarked with my Baggage, and in two Days came to an Anchor in the Port, or Road of <hi>Chio,</hi> a very fine Iſland, moſtly inhabited by <hi>Greeks:</hi> There grows abundance of Maſtick Trees, which yield the Owners-great advantage; they grow crooked, like a Vine, and being cut, the Gum, called Maſtick, at a certain Seaſon, flows from them, and is the beſt that is to be found. The Chriſtians, both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> have their free Liberty to exerciſe their Religion, ſo that there are a great many Religious Houſes, and they enjoy greater Priviledges, than any within the Turkiſh Dominions, for here they have Bells in ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, and elſewhere they are not allowed, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at <hi>Niamoni.</hi> The Villages ſtand here ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thick, and the Inhabitants are numerous; but the Ship coming to Anchor here, only by reaſon of bad Weather, I had time to take but a ſlight View e'er I Sailed again; and paſſing many other Iſlands, as <hi>Samas, Nicaria, &amp;c.</hi> in the former of theſe, in the Night, I ſaw a light near the Sea, riſing and falling, as big as a large Candle, which the Patron of the Veſſel, who was a <hi>Greek,</hi> told me, always appeared in the Ruins of a Chriſtian Church, but as any Man approached it, it vaniſhed, or remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed further from them, which made me conclude, it was an <hi>Ignis fatuis,</hi> riſing from the Unctuous Vapours, and kindled by Agitation. Theſe Iſlands are now Poor, and of no great Note, though Anciently ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57084:32"/> Famous. I ſhall paſs over other that appeared on Star, and Larboard, and ſometimes a Head of us; we Sailed near ſome in great danger, by reaſon of the bad Weather, and Rocks that jutted out in the ſhallowneſs of the Sea near them, the Winds ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Waves running high; but after all, at Sun riſing, a gentle Gale blowing from the South, we ſpread our Sails, and cleared our Veſſel of a dangerous Streight, between ſome Rocks and Iſlands, that we were fallen in with; and about Evening, ſhifting to the North Weſt, we ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way South and by Eaſt, ſo that next Morning we made the Iſland of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and about Noon came to an Anchor in a good Harbour, to recruit our ſelves with Proviſions, for the Storms we met with ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt we brought with us, the Waves frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rowling over the waſt of our ſmall Veſſel, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Violence, ſo that a great deal of Water enter'd her, and all Hands were at the Pump Night and Day.</p>
               <p>This noted Iſland has <hi>Lycia</hi> to the North, a Sea 20 Miles over, ſeparating them. To the Eaſt, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus;</hi> to the Weſt, <hi>Candie;</hi> and to the South, <hi>Aegypt;</hi> it lies in a temperate Climate, and is in Circuit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 100 Miles; few Clouds are ever ſeen over it; it is very Fruitful, and the <hi>Turks</hi> ſtrugled long before they could be entire Maſters of it, which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Reign of <hi>Solyman the Magnificent;</hi> for the City that gave the Name to this Iſland, was then taken, at the Expence of 150000 <hi>Turks,</hi> from the great Maſter, and Renowned Knights, Hoſpitallers, who Immortallized their Fame, in defending it to the laſt extremity. This City has two commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Harbours, did not the great one lie ſo open to the Eaſt, and North-Eaſt Winds, that ſometimes drive Ships from their Anchors, The <hi>Turks</hi> have built a ſtrong new Tower in the place of the old one, to command the Entrance, and Centinels are placed in Turrets, to give Notice of the approach of Ships. It has a Baſtion and Curtain, that reaches to the Town, ſo that it makes one ſide of the Port,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57084:33"/> and there is an Old Caſtle over-againſt it: Over this Port formerly ſtood a Huge Colloſſus of Braſs, one of the Wonders of the World, for it ſtood ſtrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling 50 Fathom, one Foot from another, and 70 Cubits high, ſo that Ships under Sail paſſed under it; it repreſented the Sun, and was caſt by <hi>Chares</hi> the <hi>Lydian:</hi> In one Hand it held a Light-Houſe, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Ships in, in dark Nights; but it was thrown down by an Earthquake, and being broken by the Saraſens, when they Conquered <hi>Rhodes;</hi> they ſold it to a Jew, who loaded 900 Camels with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and now the Tower and Caſtle I mentioned, are built where the Feet of it ſtood. There are many Ancient Monuments remaining in this City; as the Statue of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Note. The Eſcutcheons of Chriſtian Princes, and the Knights of the Order of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Building is Regular, and the Streets pretty Fair. But now the Wind ſerving, I was conſtrained to end my Obſervation here, and return on Board; we ſet Sail with a North-weſt Wind, and ſoon left <hi>Lindo</hi> a-ſtern, being a little Rock at the point of the Iſland of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> 20 Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues from the City, and on it there is a ſmall Town, with a very good Fort. The next that appeared was <hi>Scarpanto,</hi> 17 Leagues diſtant from <hi>Lindo,</hi> leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the Starboard, we enter'd the Gulf of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Morning proving Fair, the Man ſent up to diſcover, could, however, ſee no Land, but the whiteiſhneſs of the Water made the Sailors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, we muſt be near the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57084:33"/> is the only Mark at a great diſtance, that can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the Land lying ſo low, that it is not made till a Ship is in a manner upon it.</p>
               <p>This whiteneſs is occaſioned by the River <hi>Nile,</hi> that carries it a great way into the Sea, and at this diſtance from the Coaſt, we had many Flurreys, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with great Showers of Rain, but they were in a little time over, and the Wind coming about North-weſt, we tacked, and ſent up again to diſcover, but no Land appearing, we kept ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing South and South-weſt; but fearing to loſe the Windward of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> we ſtood Eaſt and by South, but finding that a miſtake, we tacked about that we might get nearer to the Land, from which we knew we could not be far diſtant, and held on the ſame Courſe, till we found our ſelves obliged to Tack, and bear away South-weſt; here we ſaw the Moon riſe Ecclipſed, half an hour after Sun-ſet, which was not viſible in <hi>England, Holland, France, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe there, according to the Almanacks, the Ecclips, was to happen at 3 in the Afternoon, Feb. 11. and the next Day we percieved the Sea very white about us, and the Man that looked out cryed Land; ſome thought it to be <hi>Damiette,</hi> and others <hi>Bouquer;</hi> but in the mean time, that we might not Sail to Leeward, we continued our Courſe South-weſt, and in a few Hours we Tacked and ſtood North-eaſt; and about a quarter of an hour after the Wind turning North-weſt, we bore away South and South-weſt, and in concluſion we made the <hi>Bouquer,</hi> and a little after the <hi>Farillon,</hi> or Light-Houſe of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and at 3 of the Clock in the Afternoon the ſame day, we entered the Haven by the South. One thing I found remarkable in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Land, from <hi>Damiette</hi> to <hi>Roſſetto,</hi> between the two Branches of the <hi>Nile,</hi> that from 40 Fathom Water, it leſſens every Mile till you come to Land. <hi>Aegypt</hi> is bounded on the Eaſt with the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> on the South with <hi>Aſia,</hi> on the Weſt with <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and on the North with the <hi>Mediterranean Sea.</hi>

               <p>BEING now at Land, and recovered from my Sea fatigue, by ſuitable Refreſhments, my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity lead me to take a view of this once ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned City, Founded by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, when, after his <hi>Perſian</hi> Expedition, he brought <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> under his Subjection, though it is not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to what it has been in its flouriſhing time, as may appear by the Ruins about it, and within its Circumference, and the Venerable remains of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>
               <p>This Town is called by the <hi>Turks,</hi> who poſſeſs all <hi>Aegypt, Skenderia.</hi> There are in it ſeveral Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicks, or large Houſes, where the <hi>Engliſh, French, Dutch,</hi> and other <hi>Europeans,</hi> have their appointed Reſidence, paying no Houſe Rent, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Conſuls receive Money of the Grand Signior Annually to keep them in ſuitable Repair, they being every Evening ſhut up, and the Keys carried to the Aga of the Caſtle, who ſends them back every Morning; they are likewiſe ſhut up, as is the Water-gate, every <hi>Friday,</hi> during Noon Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and this ariſes from an old Propheſie, that the <hi>Franks,</hi> for ſo they call all Chriſtian <hi>Europeans,</hi> ſhall become Maſters of that place, during Noon Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, on a <hi>Friday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Scarce any thing of the Ancient Town remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruinated but the Walls, and ſome Buildings towards the French Fondick, which are almoſt ruined; it being eaſie to diſtinguiſh the Ancient from the Later Buildings, for the latter are low, and ill-contrived.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:57084:34"/>
               <p> This once Famous Town has three Ports, one called the Old Harbour; it is pretty large, but the entrance difficult, ſo that but few Veſſels put in there; the other two are ſeparated by a little Iſland, and higher up, the Iſland was anciently called <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros,</hi> and is joyned to the main Land by a Stone Bridge, and in the middle of it is a ſquare Tower, where the Powder is kept, and at the end, another Caſtle, called <hi>Farillon,</hi> ſtanding where the Ancient Watch-Tower of <hi>Pharos</hi> ſtood, which was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The firſt of theſe Ports is a Harbour for the Galleys, and is on one ſide defended by the <hi>Farillon,</hi> and on the other by a ſlighter Caſtle; but theſe Ports are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered with Stones and Rocks, requiring a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pilot to guide in Veſſels of any conſiderable Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. The Cuſtom-houſe here is Farmed by a <hi>Turk,</hi> and has a <hi>Jew</hi> for his Deputy, and indeed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of Cuſtom moſtly paſſes through the <hi>Jew</hi>'s Hands, who can pleaſure, or diſpleaſure many that Trade there: There is alſo an Old Cuſtom houſe, but of little Note.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Alexandria</hi> there is a Mount made of Ancient Ruins, on which ſtands a ſquare Tower, and a Sentinel, who puts out a Flag ſo ſoon as he deſcrys a Sail, and every Veſſel coming into the Port pays him ſomething. All Officers here depend on the Baſſa of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who places and diſplaces them at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Walls of this Town have Fals, Brays, and are flanked with great ſquare Towers, about 200 Paces diſtant one from another, and a little Tower between every two of them; in each of the great Tower there is a large ſquare Hall, the Vault of it ſupported by Pillars of <hi>Thebaick</hi> Stone, and a great many Chambers above, and over theſe a large Platform, of 30 Foot Square, and each of theſe anciently were able to maintain 200 Men; the Walls are very thick, and every where Port-holes in them; theſe Caſtles have Ciſterns, repleniſhed with Water, but moſt part of thoſe that encompaſſed the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57084:35"/> ancient <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as it was in its Former Extent and Luſtre, are ruined by the length of Time, and neglect of Repair: but if the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officers catch an <hi>European</hi> Chriſtian in theſe Towers, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently charge him as a Spy, come to view the ſtrength of the Town, and then nothing but Money will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe him from Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Near this Town is the famous Pillar of <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſo much celebrated by Hiſtorians; it ſtands about 200 Paces diſtant, upon a little riſing, placed on a ſquare Pedeſtal, about 7 or 8 Foot high, that reſting on a ſquare Baſis, about 20 Foot broad, and 2 Foot high, made up of ſeveral large Stones; the Body of the Pillar is an entire piece of Garnet, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 6 Fathom in Compaſs, having on the Top a very curious Capital; and it muſt create Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by what ſtrong Engines ſo vaſt a Stone could be brought thither, which makes ſome believe it was caſt, and made of a certain Cement on the place, which Art was uſual with the Ancients, though now, for any thing that appears, it is loſt.</p>
               <p>In this place appears the remains of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, but all that can be called entire of it, are ſome Porphery Pillars, and a Frontiſpiece, which looks very curious. There is a <hi>Kihalis,</hi> or <hi>Canal,</hi> cut from the <hi>Nile,</hi> which brings Water to this place, and is the only good Water they have; this fills their Ciſterns that are Magnificently made, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced under in Vaults, the whole Town being hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low underneath, and ſupported by fair Marble Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and ſome ſay, there are fair Streets under Ground, wherein there are Shops to be ſeen ſtill; but the <hi>Turks,</hi> for ſome Reaſons, will not diſcover them, nor ſuffer any to go down in the Vaults that lead to them. All along, the Gardens bor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here ſtands St. <hi>Catharine</hi>'s Church, kept by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> where they ſhow a hollow Pillar, on which they ſay her Head was cut off, and would make
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57084:35"/> Travellers believe, that the Blood and Fat it is ſmeered with, remained ever ſince her Decolation. There is a pretty neat Church built to St. <hi>Mark,</hi> where he received his Martyrdome, and the Picture of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> ſaid to be drawn by St. <hi>Luke;</hi> there are to be ſeen in ſome ruinous places, Pillars of Porphyrian Marble, and Obelisks of Garnet, with Hierogliphicks upon them, yet but one of them ſtanding on a Pedeſtal.</p>
               <p>Many other things are here to be ſeen, but not to be tedious, I ſhall omit the deſcribing of all the Statues and Figures moſtly encumbered with Ruins, which are very numerous, and rather demonſtrate the former Magnificence of the place, than what it now is; and having ſetled my Affairs here, I hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Janiſary for my greater ſecurity to paſs on with me to <hi>Caire,</hi> the Principal place of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went thither, I viſited <hi>Roſſetto,</hi> about 60 miles from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> there being but one place to bait at by the way, called <hi>Maudie,</hi> or the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, becauſe you Ferry over a Lock there, full of Fiſh, though there is a Caſtle nearer called <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quier,</hi> to defend the Road, the reſt, or the greateſt part, being Deſart Sands; on the other ſide of the Water is a Kervanſerai, or Inn, where you may be welcome to Eat and Drink ſuch as you bring with you for nothing; moſt part of this Journey you Travel along the Sea-ſide: You may ſee where the <hi>Nile</hi> diſcharges it ſelf into the Sea, which is a very dangerous Paſſage, there being Saiques and Barks uſually caſt away in venturing, eſpecially when the Sea is rough, for then it occaſions an Eddy in the Water of the River, which turning the Veſſels round caſts them on Shoar. <hi>Roſſetto</hi> is the ancient <hi>Canopus,</hi> lying in a Branch of the <hi>Nile,</hi> falling into the Sea five Miles below the Town; and this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the neateſt Town in <hi>Aegypt</hi> for its Piazza's and Hans, being a Town of good Trade, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by five Gardens, the Houſes high and well built, Proviſions plenty, and at a very cheap Rate. From hence taking Water on the <hi>Nile,</hi> I paſſed with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57084:36"/> many others to <hi>Boulac,</hi> a Port of <hi>Caire.</hi> This is a long narrow Town, built on the ſide of the <hi>Nile,</hi> and has about it many pleaſant Gardens and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Houſes; and here by Cuſtom, you muſt, being a <hi>Frank,</hi> pay at your firſt coming to <hi>Caire</hi> a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtre, which is received by <hi>Jews,</hi> Authorized for that purpoſe. At this place we hired Aſſes to go to <hi>Caire,</hi> which the <hi>Moors</hi> kept ready ſadled, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to wait for Travellers, and accommodate them, and you have the Aſs, and the Maſter's Attendance for a ſmall Charge; the latter running after and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Aſs on, and crying, <hi>look to it,</hi> which the Aſs hearing, is very cautious of ſtumbling.</p>

This City is Scituate at the Foot of a Hill, on which a Caſtle is built to Command it, which renders it unhealthful, inſomuch, that the Peſtilence often rages there, and ſweeps away a multitude of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the Wind intercepts the free paſſage of the Wind and Air, and occaſions a ſtifling Heat; and the good Water they have is brought on Camels Backs from <hi>Boulac</hi> in <hi>Bourachios,</hi> which is half a League from the City, and this Water is ſold very dear.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:57084:36"/>
               <p> This City is exceeding large, and full of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being in the form of a Creſcent, yet is narrow, and may be compaſſed in two Hours and a quarters Walking: It is ſurrounded with many ſtateley Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of the Beys, and other great Men of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; the Houſes are little, but full of People, ſo that when the Plague ſweeps away 200000, it is hardly perceived, eſpecially in a little time after. The Walls have handſom Battlements and Towers, at leſs than 100 Paces interval, able to hold many Soldiers; they appear to have been very Stately, but at preſent moſtly ruinous. The Caſtle likewiſe is much decayed, the <hi>Turks</hi> being Supine, make lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle account of repairing them; near the Walls are large Church Yards, full of Sepulchers, adorned with fair Stone, that gives a pleaſant Proſpect, and all agree, that in this City there are 23000 Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, and as many Moſques, there being one in a Precinct at leaſt. A Precinct is a ſet part, and in ſome of them there are ſeveral Streets; and each Precinct is watched by two Men Chained together, to prevent them from ſeparating, and they demand certain dues of the Inhabitaints and Strangers; the Sons-Baſſa keeps the Keys of the Padlocks that lock up their Chains. The Streets here are ſhort and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, except the Street of <hi>Bazar</hi> and the <hi>Khalis,</hi> which is dry but 3 Months in the Year, and few People frequent it; the reſt are little, turning and winding, which makes me believe the Houſes were firſt built without any deſign of compacting them into a City, every one placing his Houſe on the ground he liked beſt to build on, without conſidering whether they ſtopped the Street or not. Some Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques are very Magnificent, with curious Frontiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces and Gates, with very high Minarets; but the greateſt part are little and inconſiderable; The faireſt is called <hi>Degemiel Azem.</hi> The Houſes are high, with flat Taraſs-Roofs, where they take the freſh Air when the Sun is down, and lie on Carpets there in the heat of Summer.</p>

               <p> On the out-ſide the Houſes make little ſhow, but within, they are Richly adorned with Gold and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure, eſpecially thoſe of Quality, and their Halls have an open round hole in the Roofs, to let in the cool Breathings of the Air, and commonly there is a Cupulo, or Lanthorn, over the hole, to keep out bluſtering Winds.</p>

The River</hi> Nile, <hi>and the Creatures found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> &amp;c,</head>
               <p>HAving taken a view of <hi>Caire,</hi> I was deſirous to ſee thoſe Wonders of the World ſo much every where diſcourſed of, <hi>viz.</hi> The Piramids of <hi>Aegppt.</hi> Theſe are ſeated on a Sandy Plain; two of them are ſhut, but the third, which is biggeſt is open, and ſeated very near the other, two or three Leagues from New <hi>Caire.</hi> This is a vaſt Artificial Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, built moſtly of Stones of a Prodigious big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though they differ in that, for in Reaſon, we cannot ſuppoſe, that ſo many Stones of an equal bigneſs ſhould be found for the ſupplying ſo ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious a Work; yet the ſmalleſt are a Foot thick, and 2 Foot in length; ſome 3 Foot thick, 6 long, and 4 broad: The highth of the greateſt of theſe is 520 Foot, and each Face in breadth 682 Foot.</p>
               <p>The Aſcent conſiſts of between 200 and 210 Steps; the Top, to thoſe that are below, appears like the point of a Spire, though on the top there is a Platform of 24 Foot ſquare, and is paved only
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57084:37"/> with 12 Stones, ſome of which are broken, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worn out by time; and from thence you have a Proſpect of <hi>Old Caire, Boulack,</hi> the Ruins of the Ancient famed <hi>Memphis,</hi> the Mountains and Deſarts of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but it requires a ſtrong Head to look down to the bottom, where Men and Cattle ſeem no bigger than Crows, and a good Arm cannot throw a Stone beyond the Foundation, for it will light upon ſome part of the Work; there were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Steps on every ſide, but Time, the Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all things, has waſted and crumbled ſeveral of the Stones, ſo that in ſome parts there are dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Precipices, therefore Strangers take with them a Guide, who is uſed to Aſcend, and it is their ſafeſt way: They as it were clamber up the Steps, being of that heighth, that they are forced to uſe their Hands and Knees, ſome 3 Foot, and others leſs; there is a Room by the way to reſt and refreſh one, in which are divers Images, Sculptures, and other Contrivances, according to the manner of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and near the bottom you enter into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Alley 30 Paces long, and 3 Foot high, ſo that one muſt ſtoop very low; at the end of this there is a place to creep through like a little Wicket, which is even with the Ground; and this brings you into another little Alley like the former, only in this you muſt aſcend, and this Alley ends in two others; that on the right Hand has no inclination, and leads to a vaulted Chamber 18 Foot long, and 12 broad; at the entrance into this Alley is a very deep Well, or Pit, though deſtitute of Water, in which are divers Caves, entering at the bottom, by the ſides, and into this one muſt be let with Ropes, having a lighted Torch or Tapour, for it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dark, which you muſt take care to ſecure, by reaſon of the great number of Bats that are bred, and flutter about that dark aboad; wherefore the more Prudent carry Tinder-boxes along with them, to re-kindle the extinguiſh'd Light: Oppoſite to the laſt Alley, there is another that begins ſo high in the Wall, that we were conſtrained to climb up
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57084:38"/> to it, but to make amends, we found it much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and broader than the reſt; and having walked 70 Paces, ſtill aſcending, a ſpacious Room diſcloſed it ſelf, which was 33 Foot long, and 16 broad, pav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with 9 entire Stones, the length of them equal to the breadth of the Room; the Walls are of a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Porphery, and at one end there is an empty Tomb of a very hard Stone, between 7 and 8 Foot long, and between 3 and 4 Foot broad, but broken about the Edges by ſuch as viſited the place, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them as a Token. This Tomb is held to be made for the ſame <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that was over-whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> purſuing the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Piramid ſtanding neareſt to this is little, in compariſon of it, being only 150 Foot, and each of the Sides or Faces 200 Foot broad: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion is, that it was built by a beautiful Woman, called <hi>Rhodope,</hi> who was <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s fellow Slave in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> with whom the King became Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd, and ſhe got ſo much Money by her Love Intrigues, as defrayed the Charges of building it. The third is little inferiour to the firſt, for it is 510 Foot in heighth, and the breadth of each Face is 630 Foot, being a manner a Quadrilatrial Figure, as are the reſt.</p>
               <p>There is to be obſerved the Ruins of an Ancient Temple, before each of them, and a huge Idol of Stone ſtanding very near thoſe ruinated Structures, about 26 Foot high, and in all, proportionable, where they ſay, Oracles were delivered of old; but the Cheat now appears plain, for in the Head of it there is a deep hole, wherein a Man may eaſily hide himſelf; and here, no doubt, the Prieſt was placed who gave the Oracle to delude the People, his Noiſe coming through holes made in the Noſtrils of the Idol; and ſo we may conclude of the reſt, who with Ambiguous Anſwers, abuſed thoſe that came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire future Events, or to be reſolved in doubtful Matters. This <hi>Coleſſus</hi> is cut in a Rock, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Woman.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:57084:38"/>
               <p> From hence we Travelled to a large Village, called <hi>Sacara,</hi> the Burying-place of the Ancient <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> in which there are Catacombs, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcheral Vaults. Theſe are diſtinct Subteraneous Chambers built of ſquare Stone; and in theſe are the Bodies that are called the <hi>Mummies</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where a Moor is the Maſter of them, to open them for ſuch as will give him Money, the entrance o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways being covered with Sand; the opening is above, through which one muſt go, and ſo down by a Ladder, or with a Rope; they were heretofore full of Bodies of the Ancient <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> ſo skilfully Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed, that they were, perhaps, preſerved 3 or 4000 Years, with their Epitaphs in Letters of Gold on Cloth; their Coffins were enriched with Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliphicks, and the Figures of the Deceaſed in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evo, and many Images, much Gold, and Jewels, were found with the Bodies; but the covetouſneſs of the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and the curioſity of the <hi>Franks,</hi> who purchaſe them of the former at a dear Rate, have almoſt exhauſted them, though 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there are ſome that were never opened, and that the <hi>Moors</hi> conceal them out of Avarice, to take out what is precious, and raiſe the price of ſuch Rarities to a higher Rate: Being let down in one of theſe Vaults, I ſaw many parts of Bodies, but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle entire, they being much broken and mangled by ſuch as had, out of Curioſity, carried away pieces of them.</p>
               <p>This place is full of Piramids, but moſt of them very ſmall, unleſs one that never was finiſhed, which, if compleated, had been near in bigneſs, to the largeſt I have mentioned, proportionable to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis; there are in it, Aſcending and Deſcending Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, at the end of which are 3 Rooms; but it not being finiſhed as the reſt, as to what it might have been is but Conjecture; ſome hold that this mighty Work ceaſed when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great ſeized on <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> wreſted the Kingdom from the Race of the Ancient <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Kings.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:57084:39"/>
               <p> On the other ſide of the <hi>Nile,</hi> oppoſite to this place, are to be ſeen the Ruins of the Ancient <hi>Memphis,</hi> where the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Kings held their Court; but Time, and the ſpoiling Hand of War, has made it as <hi>Troy,</hi> a heap of Ruins: It ſeems to have been exceeding large, and extended along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, till you come over-againſt <hi>Old Caire,</hi> ſo that although I ſpent many Hours in viewing theſe Ruins, I could find nothing of Note, but pieces of Pillars, and Images, the low Foundations of what ſeem to have been Ancient Temples, and little elſe Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable.</p>
               <p>Returning towards <hi>Caire,</hi> I came to <hi>Maltherea,</hi> 3 Miles diſtant from the City, where are a great many curious ſhading Orange-Trees, and a delicious Spring of Water, which is ſaid to have been the abiding place of the Bleſſed Virgin, when ſhe fled with our Saviour into <hi>Aegypt:</hi> There are likewiſe Mirtle, and Lemon-Trees, that render the place very pleaſant. This Spring and <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Well in <hi>Caire,</hi> are all the Springs of Water I could ſee or hear of in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> That Well is of a prodigious Depth, cut in a ſolid Rock 106 Foot deep, yet ſo broad and winding are the Steps, that two Oxen may go down to the bottom, where, in a Hole, is a very curious Spring, and that Water is held precious; near it are ſome remains of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Pallace, and a Room called <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Hall, adorned with Gold and Azure, and many Pillars, alſo his Steward's Houſe, remarkable for 12 Columns of Thebaick Marble. Near to this there is a dreadful Priſon, in which, it is held, that Patriarch was caſt, upon the falſe Accuſation of his Miſtreſs; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of ſeveral Dungeons cut of the Rock, and if Tradition be true, his caſe in that place could not but be lamentable, for it appears very Diſmal and Loathſome.</p>
               <p>The common received opinion that it Rains not in <hi>Aegypt</hi> is groundleſs; the Showers fall ſeldomer, and leſs violently than in other places, ſo that a great part of the Country is dry and barren Sand;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57084:39"/> the chief Fertility is occaſioned by the melting of the Snow from the Mountains, and the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the River <hi>Nile,</hi> of which famous River, I come now to ſpeak more particularly.</p>
               <p>This River has its ſource near the Mountains of the Moon, or Jews Mountains in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> where it is very ſmall, but gathers many Rivers in long run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which makes it ſwell much; it runs through the length of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> having its courſe from South to North, diſcharging it ſelf into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, by two Mouths, making a Triangular Iſle, by the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Delta,</hi> becauſe it reſembles the Greek Δ; theſe Mouths are Navigable for large Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; for though it has others, they are leſs, and can properly be called no other than Rivulets; It is broader than the <hi>Seine,</hi> and for the moſt part glides ſmoothly, unleſs where its Cataracts make it rage and foam, by its falling from a great heighth; when it overflows it appears like a little Sea, the Water is naturally thick and muddy, but they have a way to Clarifie it, by running it through Veſſels filled with white Earth, and then it is very wholeſome. Moſt of the Cities, Towns, and Villages, are Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate on its Banks, or very near it, for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of Water, which is precious in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for there are ſo many Villages, that you have ſcarce paſſed one, but you come at another. This River abounds not much with Fiſh, and there is but one good ſort found at <hi>Caire,</hi> called a <hi>Variole,</hi> but there are a vaſt number of <hi>Crocodiles</hi> in it, who, no doubt, devour the Fiſh; this is an Amphibeous Creature, living at pleaſure in the Water, or on Land; the Head of it is flat above and below, and the Eyes or it indifferently big, and very darkiſh; they have a long ſharp Snout, with long ſharp Teeth, but no Tongue to be perceived; the Body large, and all of a bigneſs; the Back covered with high Scales, like the Heads of large Nails, of a greeniſh colour, ſo hard, that they are Proof againſt a Halbert; their Tailes are very long, covered over with Scales, but the Belly is white, and pretty ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57084:40"/> it has four ſhort Legs, with five Claws on the foremoſt Feet, and but four on the hinder. It grows as long as it Lives, and ſome are about 20 Foot from Head to Tail; theſe great ones many times ſnap young Children at Land, and ſometimes put up their Noſes, and pull People out of their Boats in the River; ſo that many go with Spikes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their putting up their Noſes; and it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſwim, where their haunts are: But that they Weep when they have taken their Prey, is, for what I could find, a Fable.</p>
               <p>To take theſe Creatures, they make a great many Pits by the River ſide, and cover them with rotten Sticks, ſo that paſſing over, the Sticks give way, and they fall in; then Men let down a Rope with a running Nooze, to muzzle their Snouts, and ſo they draw them up, and kill them for their Skins, which they ſell to Strangers at good Rates: None but the <hi>Moors</hi> will Eat of their Fleſh.</p>
               <p>There is alſo in the River a Hyppopotamuſes, or Sea-Horſe, and is of a tawney Colour, the hinder part like a Bouffler, though its Legs are ſhort, yet very thick; it has the muzzle of an Ox, and ſome are about the bigneſs of a Camel: its Head reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that of a Horſe, and is very great, but the Eyes are ſmall; the Ears little; the Neck thick; the Tail like an Elephant's; in the lower Jaw it has four Teeth half a Foot long, two of them are crooked, and as big as the Horn of an Ox in circumference.</p>
               <p>This famous River mainly fertiliſes <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and without it, it would be deſolate; nay, if it ſhould fail but one Year to overflow, there would be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the Land, which ſome hold it did for ſeven Years, when the mighty Famine happen'd in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s time, reſtrained by an Almighty Power; but ſeeing that Famine extended to others Land., this may be but Conjectural; when it Ebbs it leaves a fat nitreous Slime, that greatly enriches the Land, and makes it produce plentifully. They have few Fruit-Trees, and no Wine; for the ſmall quantity of Grapes found, are thick rhined, producing lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57084:40"/> Juyce. The chief Trees are, the Fig-Trees of <hi>Pharo,</hi> the true Sycamore, Caſſa, Papyrus, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe, Orange, Lemon and Myrtle Trees, but theſe three laſt are moſtly brought thither; they have great ſtore of Onions, and other Roots; alſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Corn, and divers ſorts of fine Fowls, as Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Birds, wild Turtles, Pidgeons, and Larks; and indeed <hi>Aegypt</hi> may be rightly termed an Earthly Paradiſe, did not the Oppreſſion of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors much abate the Peoples pleaſure, but that is very great, as in other parts of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>At the cutting of the Khalis, or Sluyce of the <hi>Nile,</hi> there is a great Feſtival held, and triumphant Shows by Land and Water, with much rejoycing for many Days, and whereas the Ancient <hi>Aegyptians</hi> uſed to Sacrifice a Boy and a Girl taken by lot, to their fancied God of the River; but the <hi>Turks</hi> abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed that ill Cuſtom, and inſtead thereof, place on each ſide, in the Night, the reſemblance of a Man and a Woman in Fire, by fixing Lamps ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dexterouſly to repreſent their Figures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as other Countries under the Turkiſh Government, conſiſts of a mixed People, of divers Nations, as <hi>Turks, Jews, Arabs, Franks, Armenians, Greeks, Moors,</hi> and the Ancient Inhabitants, who have liberty to exerciſe their Religion as they pleaſe, but have Mulcts ſet upon them, for the <hi>Turks</hi> care not what they do in that nature, ſo they can ſcrew Money out of them, they being, next to the <hi>Jews,</hi> the moſt covetous of all People. The Chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under the Grand Signior is in the Hands of a Baſſa, who has his Sub Baſſa's: The great Men of the Country are called Beys, who often bring his Head into danger, if he diſpleaſes them, by their ſending complaints to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port: And thus having given you an account of the moſt conſiderable rarities of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as to what I ſaw there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall further entertain you with my Travels to <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> or the <hi>Holy-Land.</hi>

               <p>BEING deſirous to viſit the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> ſo much Famed throughout the World, for the many Wonders God wrought there, and the many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable and Venerable Antiquities yet to be ſeen. I provided my ſelf of ſuch Neceſſaries, as my Reaſon dictated, and as I was told I ſhould ſtand in need of. Upon Notice that a Caravan was ready to part, I went and enter'd my ſelf one of the Company; ſo every one having Notice, and being in a readineſs, we ſet forward, but the Wind blowing hard, we had like to have been over-whelmed with Clouds of Sand raiſed by it, which flying about our Ears, ſpoiled ſome of our Proviſion; however, the Storm being over in 3 or 4 Hours, we kept on our way, with Timbrels Sounding, to chear the Cammels, that they might purſue their Journey with more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity. The firſt place that offered it ſelf to us, was <hi>Ithanque,</hi> a little Town, where the Caravan of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> makes its firſt Stage; the next was <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys,</hi> and from thence we proceeded, the next Day to <hi>Salabia,</hi> where are the pleaſant Woods of <hi>Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risk,</hi> and there we lay in Tents, ſetting Guards, for fear of a ſurprize from Robbers, lurking in thoſe Woods: Our Caravan conſiſting of above 100 Camels, beſides Mules, and Horſes, with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſtrength of Men, but no attempt was made;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57084:41"/> and the next Evening we reached <hi>Elbir Devedar,</hi> and encamped near ſome dirty Wells of Water, that our Beaſts might be the better refreſhed; and then marched to <hi>Catice,</hi> where we had a Guard of <hi>Turks</hi> Armed, to conduct us to <hi>Riche,</hi> for now we were come within danger of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> and there I ſaw a long Pit, of fine white Salt, which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple affirmed was made only of Rain Water. We parted from thence, and went to <hi>Birlab,</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſted there, we journied to <hi>Bir Acat,</hi> a place in the Deſart deſtitute of Water, yet full of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; however, we were forced to lie there; but the next Day travelling on, we found a Well, called <hi>Sibile-El-Bar-Acat,</hi> made by an Aga, who paſſed that way in his Journey to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> it is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a Dome, ſupported by Pillars. This Water very much refreſhed us, and our Cattle; but going from hence we entered again into the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, which reach as far as <hi>Riche,</hi> and well it was we got to that place, for about a quarter of an Hour after a Storm aroſe, which laſted about 30 Hours. This Village is not far from the Sea, and has a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle built of little Rock Stones, as is likewiſe all the Houſes of the Village; and here I obſerved they had ſo much Marble, that their Wells were made of that Stone, and their Burying-places are full of them. Having refreſhed our ſelves, we departed for <hi>Cauniows,</hi> with a Guard of 8 <hi>Turks,</hi> and from thence we Travelled through Quick-ſands, though it Rained, Thundered, and blew hard, to <hi>Zaka,</hi> a place where no Houſes are, for that Name was only given it from three Wells of Brackiſh Water we found there, but paſſing on, we came to Wells of pleaſant Water, and now we begun to have a proſpect of a fine Country, where ſome Corn-Land appeared, which much encouraged us; there we found many pleaſant Trees, and good Meadows, ſo that now we concluded we were on the Borders of the <hi>Land of Promiſe,</hi> and indeed we ſoon reached the City of <hi>Gaza,</hi> which ſtands about two Miles from the Sea, and was anciently very Stately and Famous for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57084:42"/> Trade; many of the Ancient Pillars are yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there being almoſt every where Marble Pillars to be ſeen; it was one of the five Lordſhips of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> the Gates of which <hi>Sampſon</hi> carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way on his Shoulders, and left them on a little Hill a Mile diſtant. Near the City there is a Caſtle, with 4 corner Towers, and the Gates are of Iron: Hard by this are found lumps of ruined Walls, that cannot be broke with a Hammer, being the Ruins of a Caſtle, built by the Ancient <hi>Romans;</hi> near the Caſtle, behind the Burying-place, where we encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtood the Houſe that <hi>Sampſon</hi> pulled down, when he by that means deſtroyed ſo many <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> and many other things of Note, which I had not time to obſerve, by reaſon the Caravan was in haſte to depart.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Gaza</hi> we paſſed to a Village, called <hi>Megdel,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Ithanſedoud;</hi> all the way there are pleaſant Plains, full of Trees and Corn, and in the Seaſon theſe Plains are Embroidered with Tulips and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that grow without planting; ſo paſſing a Village called <hi>Yebna,</hi> at the end of it we croſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Bridge, and from thence proceeded over love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Plains to <hi>Rama,</hi> and encamped in a Plain over-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; however, I went with a few others, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit ſome Merchants that reſided there: This Town depends on the Baſſa of <hi>Gaza.</hi> Here is the Houſe of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> now inhabited by French Merchants; there is alſo a pretty Church: The Church of the Forty Martyrs is in this Town. The Doors of the Houſes are not above 3 Foot high, and they make them ſo, on purpoſe to prevent the Inſolent <hi>Arabs,</hi> that Border on them, from entring their Houſes on Horſeback: there is likewiſe a Church Dedicated to the Honour of St. <hi>George.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Decamping from hence at 6 a Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſaw, about 9, on our right Hand, the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Good Thief,</hi> called in <hi>Arabick, Bethlakij.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that we paid the Caffaire, or Cuſtom, and ſo had a Guard allowed us to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but being l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Some Arches of the Ruins are yet ſtanding above, and many others under Ground, where the <hi>Arabs</hi> keep a few Cows; a Spring of pleaſant Water iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a Rock near it.</p>
               <p>The next day, we paſſed on towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> once exceeding Famous, but now contracted into a ſmall compaſs; we left <hi>Degib,</hi> a ſmall Village, ſo called in <hi>Arabick,</hi> and was once the Town of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet; it ſtands upon an Eminence, there is a Moſque covered with a Dome, they ſay <hi>Samuel</hi> is Buried there, and the <hi>Jews</hi> viſit it out of Devotion; and ſoon after we diſcovered the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Coudscherif,</hi> and came before it, but being <hi>Franks,</hi> as they call the Latin Chriſtians, we could not be admitted till the Religious ſent for us; and when we had waited about an Hour, at that which is called the Gate of <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> we were introduced by the Trucheman of the Convent, who came with an Officer belonging to the <hi>Baſha</hi> of the Province, who viſited the Bagage, and then we were conducted to the Convent of St. <hi>Saviour,</hi> who Entertained us Charitably, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to an Apartment were we might reſt our ſelves, and a Monk came and waſhed our Feet, and the Religious were very Induſtrious to ſhew us the places of Note, and to begin our viſits of the Holy Places. Firſt we paſſed near to the <hi>Judgment Hall,</hi> from whence our Saviour went out bearing his Croſs; it is ſo called, becauſe, thoſe that were Condemned to die, went out of the City by it: At preſent within the City, advanced a few ſteps, proceeding on our way, we paſs under an Arch, where is a Stone on which they ſay, <hi>Pilate</hi> ſet our Saviour, when he ſaid, <hi>Ecce Homo, Behold the Man.</hi> This is a large Arch reaching from one ſide of the Street to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and has two Windows looking into the Street, only ſeparated by a little Marble Piller, and under this Window is an Inſcription, <hi>viz. Tode Tolle Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifice</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:57084:43"/> 
                  <hi>eum;</hi> Take and Crucifie him. A little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Palace of <hi>Herod,</hi> from whence our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was ſent back to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and although theſe two were at variance before, yet the Prince of Peace paſſing between them, they ſoon, even that very day, were at Agreement: And indeed, there are many of the Antient Structures remaining, though this famous City has undergone ſo many Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet it is Conjectur'd, that many new Works have been added to the Old Ruins, and they much repaired in many places. The <hi>Sheep Gate</hi> ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains entire, and over the place where our Saviour was Scourged, there is a pretty Chaple Erected; the Front and ſome other parts of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple are yet remaining, and there are ſeveral Arches that make a lovely Porch before the Door of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; nor is the Tower of <hi>David</hi> quite defeated, there remaining many Ruins to ſhew the Strength and Magnificence of it. There are abundance of Chaples in this City, ſome belonging to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Chriſtians,</hi> others to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and ſome to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians Abaſines,</hi> &amp;c. and theſe were raiſed on ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religious occaſions, where the paſſages in Holy Scripture are recited to have hapned; but they pay the <hi>Turks</hi> a large tribute for poſſeſſing them, yet they get much Money by the viſits that are made in Pilgrimages, the <hi>Turks</hi> often choping and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thoſe that will give moſt Money, and they who are the richeſt, commonly poſſeſs thoſe that are moſt in Veneration, and conſequently moſt frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but above all the reſt that are very numerous, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher is in the higheſt Veneration, therefore I ſhall briefly deſcribe it.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Franks</hi> that enter it at firſt, are taxed 24 Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters a piece, and the Religious pay only 12; but when you have once paid that Tax, and Entered it, you may go in as often as you will when it is open, giving a Mudine to the <hi>Turk,</hi> who keeps the Door.</p>
               <p>Before you enter into the Church, you paſs a kind of a large Court that is before it, laid with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; and on this, the <hi>Jews</hi> do not, or, as ſome ſay,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57084:43"/> dare not tread: Then the Steeple appears, which is on the left ſide corner of the Front of the Church; it is ſquare on all ſides, has three ſtories of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, two in front, ſupported and ſeparated by two Marble Pillars, and heretofore is ſaid to have 18 Bells in it. The Door of this Church is very Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, and over it are many Figures in Braſs Relicks, being the Repreſentations of ſeveral Sacred Hiſtories; the Door is ſealed with the Seal of the <hi>Baſha,</hi> and when any enter, it is immediately ſhut again. In this Church, there is the Chaple of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition, ſo called; becauſe it is held, our Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in that place to the Bleſſed Virgin, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his Reſurrection; and from thence we went down to the Chaple of St. <hi>Helena,</hi> Inventrix of the Croſs, and having viewed ſome others, we paſſed through the ſaid Chaple, where it was told the Women, that Chriſt was riſen in this Chaple. There is a little Altar, and three Windows to give light before the Door, a Lamp, and ſeven Lamps within it, and there lies a Stone ſaid to be rowled from the mouth of our Saviour's Sepulcher, on which the Angel ſet, when his Brightneſs appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo tranſparent.</p>
               <p>On the right hand as you enter, is the place where the Body of our Lord was laid in, cut out of the Rock, in which there is a Table of the ſame Rock raiſed about two Foot from the Ground, or ſomewhat more. This takes up one half of the Breadth, and the whole length of the Chaple; it has been faced with white Marble to prevent its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken, for the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who came to viſit it, ſtrove eagerly to have little Bits of it, to place in Rings and other Gold Ornaments as a precious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. And now it ſerves for an Alter, where the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Prieſts celebrate Maſs, none being permitted to do the like; and in the Roof of it are three Holes to evaporate the Smoak of the Lamps, there being 44 of them in it of Silver and Gold, ſent by the Kings of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and other Princes. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of this place is faced with White Marble, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57084:44"/> environed on the out-ſide with 10 curious Pillars of the ſame Stone, and the Lamps are round about it. It is covered with a Plat-form in the middle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of juſt over the Holes that Evaporate the Smoak, there is a Dome about 6 Foot in Height, covered with Lead, which ſtands upon 12 little Porphery coloured Pillars, two and two on the Plat-form, which makes ſix Arches, and under every one of them hangs 3 Lamps; though when it runs, the Water falls through the Aizie in the Dome of the Church, on the little Dome, from whence it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by a Pipe into a hole.</p>
               <p>Before the Door of the Sepulcher, at an equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from it, and the Door of the Quire, is a prodigeous Lump of Silver; they ſay, that two Men can hardly Fathom it, it was ſent by <hi>Philip</hi> III. of <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe Arms are on it in ſeveral places with this Motto: <hi>Philipus</hi> III. <hi>Rex Hiſpaniorum me donavit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Quire and the Body of the Church is of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Work; it is ſaid to be placed in the middle of the World, becauſe in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 74. its ſaid, <hi>God wrought Salvation in the midſt of the Earth,</hi> but not to be too tedious in this matter, I muſt cut ſhort and proceed to other places. We went ſoon after to viſit the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> the place where our Lord wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and foretold its Deſtruction; and from thence indeed there is a curious proſpect of the City. On the top of this Mount is the place of the Aſcenſion, where is a Chaple with 8 Fronts, and a little Dome covered with Lead, ſupported by 8 Pillars of White Marble; in this Chaple is the print of a Foot on a piece of Rock, which they ſay, our Saviour left when he Aſcended; and that there was an other of them which the <hi>Turks</hi> have cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and kept to ſhew to ſuch as will give Money to ſee it in the Temple of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Then we viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Gzot,</hi> in which it is held the Apoſtles made the Creed, and the Sepulchers of <hi>Abſalon</hi> and <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat;</hi> the Valley wherein they ſtand is no other now, than a great Ditch, that conveys the Water
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57084:44"/> from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but the chief <hi>Jews</hi> hire their Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Places here of the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſuperſtitiouſly fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Judgment will firſt begin here at the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reſurrection, and therefore they who are Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, ſhall be firſt diſpatched. About <hi>Abſalon</hi>'s Tomb is a great heap of Stones, for every one that paſſes by, is obliged to throw a Stone at it, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of his Rebellion againſt his Father.</p>
               <p>Near this, there is the Tomb of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and the Brook <hi>Kedron;</hi> this Brook has over it a Stone-Bridge, but many times it is dry, as it hapned at this time, ſo that we paſſed over without wetting our Feet, though not near the Bridg.</p>
               <p>As for the Garden of <hi>Olives,</hi> it is a very ſmall place, and few Trees remaining in it; it is incloſed with a very inconſiderable Wall, and into it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Garden of <hi>Bethſemany,</hi> where our Saviour was in his Agony, and near it is the Sepulcher of of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which is a Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt under ground, of it, nothing but the Front can be ſeen, and hereabouts are ſeveral other Sepulchers to be ſeen, as thoſe of <hi>Joachin</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> and the place where St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was Stoned; ſo entering by St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Gate, we came to the <hi>Sheep-pool,</hi> which is near to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple; and here are yet to be ſeen the Sepulchers of <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloin,</hi> the firſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that of his Brother <hi>Balwin,</hi> and others that ſucceeded him, though time has much defaced ſome of them. From hence I went to Mount <hi>Calvery,</hi> where is a Hole half a foot Diameter, and 2 foot Deep, in which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there ſay, the Croſs ſtood when our Saviour was Crucified; they ſhewed a Rock, with a cleft in it, that they ſay rent at his giving up the Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>My curioſity now led me to viſit the Burying Places of the Kings of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is of great Antiquity; and to this you go out of the City by the Gates of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and when I came there, I entered into a great Court, cut out and made even in a Rock, and the Rock ſerves to it as a Wall; and on the left hand there is a Gallery cut out of the ſame
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57084:45"/> Rock, with ſeveral Pillars beautified with Stone, Embeliſhed with curious Figures, and Engravenings on Stone; and there is a little open place at one end of this Gallery, through which I crept on my Hands and Knees, and then found a large ſquare Room cut out of the Rock; and further there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rooms, and curious ſquare Tombs cut out of the Rock alſo, ſo that it ſeem'd a Palace rather than a Burying place, though here many of the Antient Kings of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> lye Interr'd; and returning from this Magnificent Palace of the Dead, I went to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the Cave, where, it is held, the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> compoſed his Lamentations. It is a large lightſome <hi>Grot,</hi> the Roof of it ſupported by a Pillar that ſtands in the midſt of it, being very near the Burying Place of the Kings.</p>
               <p>Having been curious in making theſe Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I had a deſire to ſee the famous River <hi>Jordan,</hi> ſo renowned in Holy Writ; and ſo taking Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the way, and Company alſo to guard us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inſults of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> who watch all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to rob Strangers and <hi>Turks;</hi> We ſet forward with a great many more that had the ſame deſire, and joyning with us in our way, lay almoſt all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long among the Mountains, the Road being very Stony from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the Plains of <hi>Jerico;</hi> before the latter, our Caravan, as we may Term it, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, having paſſed <hi>Bithany,</hi> and the Fountain of the Apoſtles. Here we refreſhed our ſelves, and though <hi>Jerico</hi> was once a famous City, it now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of a few Brick Houſes, inhabited by <hi>Arabs,</hi> who live a miſerable poor life; near to this is the Houſe of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and here we found the ſo much talked of Roſes of <hi>Jerico;</hi> theſe Blow not unleſs they are put into Water, and then they Blow in all Seaſons, contrary to the Opinions of thoſe who ſay they blow not but on <hi>Chriſtmas Day,</hi> and others on all the Feſtivals of our Lady.</p>
               <p>Travelling by many places of little Note, at length we came to <hi>Jordan,</hi> and Encamped near it: On the Banks there are many Almond, and other
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57084:45"/> pleaſant Trees; it is not broader than the <hi>Thames,</hi> but very deep in moſt places, it has its beginning from 2 ſmall Springs, called <hi>Jor,</hi> and <hi>Dan,</hi> towards Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> and from them, put together, it takes its Name. The Water of this River, they ſay, will not corrupt by length of time, though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not very clear: It runs from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> and paſſing through the Sea of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> loſes its Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the <hi>Aſphalian</hi> Lake, or <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> which ſprung up in the Plains, when the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> were ſunk in Flames; in the Sylvian places, on the Bank of this River, the warbling of Birds is very Harmonious, eſpecially of Nightingals, who are there in great numbers. At this River ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paid their Devotions, in remembrance of the Wonders that had been done there; as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s paſſing it dry ſhod: <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s, dividing it with his Mantle; and our Saviour's being Baptized.</p>
               <p>As for the Dead Sea, it is a great ſtanding Lake of Salt and Bitter Water; all the Plains that border on it are Bitter, and they ſay there are Trees grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the brink of it, that bear Apples with a Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and Golden Rhine, fair to the Eye to delude Travellers, but as a Curſe on the Place, they are within, Aſhes and Smoke. Some hold, that a living thing will not ſink in this Water, but the fumes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from it were ſo extream it being hot Weather, that I thought it convenient not to approach too near it. I was informed that this Sea, or rather Lake, was 100 Miles in length, and 25 over, but that no Fiſh can live in it. In our return, I ſaw the Mount where our Saviour Faſted Forty Days, and was Tempted; on the top of it there is a Grot, wherein is an Altar: This Grot is ſaid to be the place of his Reſidence, during that time, and there the Monks ſay Maſs on publick occaſions; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down again, I ſaw the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Well, where he made the Bitter Water Sweet, by caſting Salt into it; and now the Water is of an excellent pleaſant Taſt; This Well is about a quarter of an Hours Travel from the Foot of the Mountain.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:57084:46"/>
               <p> Going now to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> they ſhewed us by the way the Houſe of St. <hi>Simeon,</hi> and the place where <hi>Elias</hi> was Born; alſo the Houſe of <hi>Jacob, Rachel</hi>'s Sepulcher, and <hi>David</hi>'s Ceſtern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was anciently a Town of the Tribe of <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>dah,</hi> and has been, as appears by the Ruins, a very fair place, but now greatly reduced: There is in it a Convent of Monks; and the place where St. <hi>Jerom</hi> reſided, and taught the People, is a pretty compact Church, dedicated to the Honour of St. <hi>Catherine:</hi> There is alſo the Sepulcher of the <hi>Innocents,</hi> where many of them that <hi>Herod</hi> cauſed to be Slain were Buried: The Oratory of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and his Tomb: The place where our Saviour was laid in the Mainger, is to be ſeen. There is an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar where the three Kings adored him, and made their precious Offerings; and all theſe places are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with pleaſant Structures and Ornaments, Lamps burning in moſt of them, and Sculptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the Hiſtories; in one of which, the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> is repreſented, kneeling before our Saviour, who has 2 Crowns of Silver on his Head, which things are the only Ornament of the place; near it is the Sealed Well, and the 3 Fiſh-Ponds of <hi>Solomon;</hi> the Well is a pleaſant little hole, but deep, with 3 Springs bubling up; at the end, Aquaducts convey the Water to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the Fiſh-Ponds ſeem to be cut out of a Rock, being ſmooth Stone at bottom, with Springs, one at the end of another, lowering by degrees, ſo that they communicate their Water; and Travelling on, there is the Garden of <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſhut in between 2 Hills, which ſerve for a Wall on either ſide; alſo the Cave where <hi>David</hi> cut off the lap of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Garment; and paſſing the Town of <hi>Sanacarib,</hi> we came in with the Mountains of <hi>Judea:</hi> the Town is called ſo, becauſe <hi>Sanacarib</hi>'s Army En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping there, was cut off by the Angel: The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is likewiſe in the way, where the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch was Baptized by St. <hi>Philip,</hi> and is a pleaſant Spring of Sweet Water; and by bad way paſſing the Village of <hi>Battir,</hi> we came to the Deſert of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57084:46"/> St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, and upon an Aſcent are ſeen the Ruins of an Old Monaſtery; under this is a Grot, where they ſay he lay, and in it, the form of a Bed cut in the Rock. There are many things to be ſeen, in the Mountains of <hi>Judea,</hi> more than here mentioned; but being tedious ways, Rockey and Stoney, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Travel further in them, they being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of many Riſings and Fallings, ſome very Craggy, others Smooth, with pleaſant ſhading Trees on them, as Olives, Palms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having reſted a little after this Journey, and eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſome Ambuſhcades of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> I, as well as many more of my Companions, being deſirous to ſee other memorable places before we left the <hi>Holy-Land,</hi> our curioſity lead us to paſs through the Gate of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> which we did, pretty early in the Morning, and the firſt thing of Note that ſaluted our Eyes, was the Foot of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> on the Right Hand, and the two Fiſh-Ponds of <hi>Berſheba,</hi> in one of which, <hi>David</hi> beheld her bathing from his Pallace in Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> when he fell enamour'd with her, and committed that grievous Sin, which made not only him but all <hi>Iſrael</hi> Mourn. Then we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Field which is called <hi>Acaldema,</hi> or <hi>the Field of Blood,</hi> and here the <hi>Armenian</hi> Strangers find a Burying-place: ſo going forward, we ſaw the Grot where 8 of the Apoſtles hid themſelves, when our Lord was made a Priſoner; it is now a pleaſant cool place for ſhelter, and in it are to be ſeen the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of the Apoſtles. Near this there is a Burying-place for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and Strangers, and a Pit, where tis ſaid, the <hi>Jews</hi> hid the Fire of the Altar, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> when they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away Captive by <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> into <hi>Babylon;</hi> cloſe by it there is a Moſque, with a Reſervatory of pleaſant Water to refreſh Travellers.</p>
               <p>But going on, we came to the Pool of <hi>Shilo,</hi> where the Blind Man waſhed, and had his ſight reſtored him, and paſſing on, ſaw where the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſawn aſunder with a wooden Saw, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Manaſſes.</hi> Then we journied by the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57084:47"/> of the Bleſſed Virgin, to the Mount of <hi>Scandall,</hi> near which <hi>Judas</hi> hanged himſelf, after he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his Lord; it is ſo called, becauſe the Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins perverted his wiſe Heart, and made him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Folly, in offering Sacrifice to <hi>Moloch,</hi> and the Idol of <hi>Chamos;</hi> and ſo we came to <hi>Bethany:</hi> There we ſaw the Ruins of the Houſe of <hi>Simeon</hi> the <hi>Lepar,</hi> where <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> anointed our Saviour with the precious Oynement; alſo the Ruins of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Lazarus</hi> on a little Aſcent, and at the Foot of it is the Sepulchre out of which he was raiſed; it is a little Grot, and in a Table of Stone, where the Prieſts on Solemn Days ſay Maſs, they ſhow there the Stone that our Saviour ſat on, when he bewailed him, and called him forth; and places where the Houſe of <hi>Martha</hi> ſtood; as alſo the Fig-Tree that withered when Chriſt Curſed it; and that where the Aſs ſtood, which he ſent for and Rod in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Then we went to the Grot where St. <hi>Peter</hi> Wept bitterly after he had denied his Maſter; and from hence we turned to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> where our Lord celebrated the Holy Supper with his Apoſtles, and inſtituted the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Here is the Room he entred when the Doors were ſhut, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcended on the Day of Penticoſt.</p>
               <p>Not far from hence we beheld the Sepulchers of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> This Mountain was formerly within the compaſs of the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but <hi>Selim</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Sultan rebuilding them, it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and the City much ſtreightned. We ſaw many other things hereabouts, as the Iron Gate, the Houſe of <hi>Zebedec,</hi> and that of the High Prieſt, <hi>Annas;</hi> the place where St. <hi>James</hi> was beheaded; the Houſes of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Mark;</hi> the Priſon of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> whence he was delivered by the Angel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now returning a little again to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I ſhall give ſomewhat more of its Deſcription than hitherto I have done.</p>
               <p>This Famous City is ſeated on a Barren Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Ground for the moſt part, it produces no

The <hi>Turks</hi> keep them all ſhut at Noon-Prayer, becauſe they have a Prophecy, that at that time, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhall ſurprize <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and particularly on a Friday, on which Day they are very apprehenſive it will happen; not far from the <hi>Golden-Gate</hi> there is a Pillar bearing out of the Wall like a Cannon, and on this the <hi>Turks</hi> have a fooliſh Opinion, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhall ſit at the Day, to ſee whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> Judges the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Uprightly, and if he does, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> will give him his Siſter in Marriage, with a great Portion; and then changing himſelf into a great Sheep, he ſhall fly up in the Air a vaſt heighth, with the <hi>Mahometans</hi> entangled in his Wool, and there ſhake himſelf terribly, and ſuch as can hold faſt ſhall go with him into Paradiſe, but ſuch as fall off ſhall drop into Hell.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57084:48"/> this Rock it is Fabled, <hi>Andromeda</hi> was tied, when <hi>Perſeus</hi> the Son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Danae</hi> delivered her from the Sea Monſter.

Here St. <hi>Peter</hi> raiſed <hi>Tabitha, Acts</hi> 9. and ſaw the Sheet let down from Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. There are Grots by the Sea-ſide for Pilgrims to reſt in; there is alſo a little Caſtle, with two Towers, one round the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſquare, and a great Tower ſeparated from it on one ſide, but no Houſes by the Sea. The Port has but little Water in it, and none but ſmall Barks can come up with the Fortreſſes. Mount <hi>Carmell</hi> being but a little diſtance from hence, by Water, I agreed with others, to take ſmall Veſſels to viſit it, but we met with a Storm by the way, that much endangered us; but at length we arrived ſafely there, and lodged in the Village of <hi>Cayplias,</hi> which, by the Ruins appears to have been formerly a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Town, it is at the Foot of the Mountain, and the next Morning we aſcended the Mountain, where we found a Convent of bare-footed Fryars, called <hi>Carmelites;</hi> theſe obſerve a very ſtrict Rule, neither eating Fleſh nor drinking Wine, totally Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtring themſelves from the World, nor will they ſuffer others to do it in their Convent. This is the place where the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> lived; and there is in this Mount, as they ſay, a Garden of Stone Mellons, which happened on this wiſe; the Prophet asking the Man to give him ſome of that he was gathering, he to put him off, told him they were Stones, when immediately they proved ſo indeed, by turning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Stone; they ſhewed us one of theſe, but would not ſhew us the place where they grew, leaſt we ſhould covet to carry them away; however, they feaſted us with Fruits, boiled Roots, and gave us Water to Drink; for though the Hill is Rockey, ye by their induſtry, they have raiſed many Fruit-Trees, and have variety of good Flowers. Then we ſaw the Well <hi>Elias</hi> made to ſpring out of the Ground, and another little Well by it; we ſaw a little diſtant from theſe, the Grot, or Cave of <hi>Elias</hi>

               <p>HAving heard many Famous Things reported of <hi>Perſia,</hi> too many here to enumerate; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recruited with Bills of Exchange, and other Advantages for Travelling, it being a curioſity I was enclined too from my tender Years, I found an opportunity to go in good Company for <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> This City is ſtill in good Reputation, and has ſix Gates, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Eaſt Gate,</hi> the <hi>Sphaies,</hi> or <hi>Seraglio Gate,</hi> the <hi>Shoo Gate,</hi> the Gate of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> the Gate of <hi>Peace,</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas's Gate:</hi> This City is an Hour and a quarters walk round it; but the Suburbs are as big again as the Town. It has in it many ſtately Buildings, ſome New, others of great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, having been Anciently the Capital City of <hi>Syria;</hi> but being on a Journey, I had not much lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to view it, or few other Towns or Cities on the way, therefore I ſhall but lightly touch on them in my Paſſage.</p>
               <p>From hence we parted for <hi>Aleppo,</hi> which is one of the moſt conſiderable Cities of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in <hi>Aſia,</hi> by reaſon of the great Trade Merchants drive there; it is as large as <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and has a fruitful Country lying about it. The Walls are ſtrong and well fortified; it has ten Gates, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny curious Buildings in it. This and the former are govern'd by Baſſa's, who have large dependencies.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57084:49"/> There is a Court of Wells, with a Canal full of good Fiſh, but the <hi>Turks,</hi> on ſome ſuperſtitious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or other, forbid any to take them, alledging, for excuſe, that thoſe who Eat them will fall Sick and Die. There are in this City People of all cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Trades, and were not the oppreſſion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> as it is indeed all over the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, very great, Riches would flow here in abundance.</p>
               <p>From this place our Road lay to <hi>Moſul</hi> by the way of <hi>Bir,</hi> and <hi>Orfa</hi> the Ancient <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> but before we came to <hi>Bir</hi> we paſſed <hi>Euphrates</hi> in great Boats. This is a little Town in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> on the ſide of the River, and paſſing by ſmall Towns, and the Ruins of ſome great ones, we came to <hi>Orfa;</hi> The Walls are about two Hours Walk in Circumference, and pretty entire, but the Town within, though it has been Fair and Stately, lies now moſtly in Ruins. We refreſhed our ſelves here, and paſſed on by <hi>Codg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſar,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Meredin</hi> and <hi>Niſibia;</hi> we ſaw in our way many Villages, ſome Towns, and other things of Note, as <hi>Job</hi>'s Tomb, Fields of Mellons, Cucumbers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our way was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times over Mountains, then into Valleys, and now and then in Plains, ſeeing but few, except ſome few wandering People, who move from place to place, feeding Cattle, and carrying their Tents with them; and after a weary Journey, we came to <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This City, Anciently called <hi>Aaſour,</hi> ſtands on the ſide of the <hi>Tigris,</hi> which runs to the Eaſt of it. It is encompaſſed with ſtrong Stone Walls, plaiſtered over; and theſe have little pointed Battlements on the top, 2 Fingers thick, and 4 or 5 broad. There is a Caſtle in the Water of an Oval Form, and pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtrong, which keeps the Paſs of the River. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Houſes are fairly built with Freeſtone, and the City is about an Hours walk in compaſs: It has five Gates, beſide that I mentioned. On the other ſide of the River is the place where once
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57084:50"/> ſtood the Famous City of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and ſome of the Ruins are to be ſeen, and not far diſtant, a Tomb, wherein <hi>Jonah</hi> is ſaid to be Buried. In Summer it is extream Hot, inſomuch, that the People keep in Vaults in the heat of the Day, and ſome in Stone Troughs of cold Water.</p>
               <p>Having recruited our Proviſions here, it being <hi>July,</hi> to prevent the danger of the <hi>Semiel,</hi> or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Wind, which ariſes about this time, kills many that Travel by Land. I, and ſome of the Company, paſſed by Water on a Keleck, or a kind of a Float, faſtned on a great many Leather Baggs, filled full of Wind; but they would not ſuffer us to carry any Wine on Board, fooliſhly fancying, that it would fink their Boat; and in this we did wiſely, for we afterwards heard of many that paſſed by Land, who were not accuſtomed to that Wind, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being ſtifled or Poyſoned with the infectious Air. In our Paſſage we ſaw many Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages; and Men, Women, and Cattle were ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Paſſage over the River. In the Night we heard the Lions Roar on either Hand, which made us keep from the Shoar, leaſt they ſhould leap into our Kelechs, though the Natives would perſwade us, they were afraid of a Man, and that the <hi>Arabs</hi> uſually purſued and killed them with a Staff; but we thought fit not to lay too much ſtreſs upon this, for I had heard in <hi>Moſul,</hi> that many who had ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the Caravans, had been ſnaped by them, for they rove in great numbers, and Fire-Arms are the beſt defence againſt them; beſides, we were forced to ſtand on our Guard, for fear of the Thieveiſh <hi>Arabs,</hi> who often get aboard by ſwiming, and ſurpriſe theſe Kelechs, nor did they fail to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum us, but when we eſpied them, they Dived, and got to Shoar, and by that means eſcaped our Shot we made at them: But to be Brief, at laſt we came to <hi>Bagdad.</hi> This is a long Town, lying on the River: The firſt thing that appears is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, to the ſide of the River, on the left Hand, and ſeems to be very well Fortified. It is built of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57084:50"/> curious white Stone, though the generality of the Houſes in the Town are low and inconſiderable; it is very ſtrong on the Land-ſide, and in circuit Large, requiring at leaſt two Hours to compaſs it, at a moderate pace on Foot; there are lovely Bagnios, and fair Bazars in it. It was Founded by the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> but taken from them by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and has a Baſſa for their Governor. It ſtands advantageous enough on the <hi>Tygris,</hi> but is thinly Peopled, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Licentiouſneſs of the Soldiers, who are ſcarcely under any Command.</p>
               <p>It is extream Hot in this place in the Summer time, as in all others of the ſame Latitude. There are but few Fruit-Trees hereabouts, but every where ſtore of Licorice. They generally uſe Oyl of <hi>Naphta</hi> in their Lamps, it being plentiful in their Borders. They often ſend their Expreſſes from place to place by Carrier Pidgeons, faſtning the Note about their Necks, which they exactly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, unleſs they are killed by the way, which rarely happens.</p>
               <p>I found here a Caravan, moſtly conſiſting of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> bound for <hi>Hamaden</hi> in <hi>Perſia;</hi> this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity I and others embraced, though we found the Retinue did not exceed ſixty, ſlenderly Armed, and moſtly without Tents, appearing reſolute and hardy; and paſſing <hi>Caranluocapi,</hi> leaving on the left the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tower <hi>Adgdadom Coulaſu,</hi> we came near <hi>Lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Hakin,</hi> and encamped there all Day, where the <hi>Chakales</hi> entertained us with Muſick: From thence we Marched, and Lodged in a Village, called <hi>Aacube,</hi> under the pleaſant Shade of divers ſpreading Palm-Trees, and ſo proceeded Eaſtward to <hi>Harounia,</hi> where are many pleaſant Gardens, and paſſing by <hi>Adiga</hi> and <hi>Immanisker,</hi> and many other Villages, we were informed the <hi>Arabs</hi> lay in wait for us in the narrow Paſſes, which cauſed us to get 15 Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries well Armed; but we needed them not, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with no oppoſition, for we ſafely arrived at <hi>Mendeli,</hi> the utmoſt bounds of the <hi>Turks,</hi> on the Frontiers of <hi>Perſia:</hi> It is a little Town and Caſtle

               <p>THE famous Kingdom of <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſo much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in Hiſtory, is the Ancienteſt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy now known in the World, having, for the moſt part, had an interrupted Succeſſion of Kings, who have Govern'd that vaſt Region Valliantly, in wiſe Conduct, and much Glory.</p>
               <p>It is bounded on the Eaſt with the great River <hi>Indus,</hi> on the South with the main Ocean, on the North with the <hi>Caſpian-Sea,</hi> and on the Weſt with the <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Perſian-Gulf,</hi> and is divided into 11 Provinces, <hi>viz. Perſis,</hi> now called <hi>Far, Suſiana, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramania, Gedroſſo, Drangiania, Irica, Arachoſſa, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapomiſus, Seccha, Hircania,</hi> and <hi>Ormus;</hi> all very large, and moſt of them Fertile.</p>
               <p>On the confines of this Kingdom, we found Men Armed with Bows and Quivers, who ſtopped us, becauſe we were advanced before the Caravan, but being certified that we belonged to it, they let us paſs. Theſe are the King's Officers, ſet on the Roads to examine Strangers, thereby to prevent Spys and Robbers entring into the Country, and are upon moſt Roads, having a pretty good Sallary out of the Treaſury for their diligence; and they get much Money of Paſſengers.</p>
               <p>Having paſſed theſe Men, we Travelled ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times over Plains, then Hills, and then into Plains
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57084:51"/> again, and through many narrow Paſſages, ſeeing on either Hand a very fruitful Country, and the <hi>Perſian</hi>'s Houſes, many of them being made of Cane, and built ſtraglingly here and there; we often chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Point, ſometimes North, or Eaſt, or South-Eaſt, as the way led us, till we came by a Village of <hi>Cures,</hi> called <hi>Nian;</hi> the Hills about it were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Turpentine, and wild Cheſnut-Trees; the Waters bordered with <hi>Agnus Caſtus,</hi> and Roſe-Laurels. Here the Weather altered, for it was very Cold in compariſon of the Hot Countries we had paſſed before. From hence we paſſed to a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, called <hi>Chegiafer,</hi> it is compoſed of ſtragling Houſes, of rough Stone, Earth, Cane, and Reeds, covered with green Branches; the former are their Summer-Houſes, and the latter their Winter-Houſes. Their Moſques in this place are built of rough Stone and Earth, and on the way there are many Kervanſerais commodious to Inn at, very fine for the moſt part, being beautified with a kind of black Stone, ſome polliſhed and ſome rough; but paſſing on through a vaſt track of Country, we came to <hi>Hamadan,</hi> to which place the Caravan was bound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hamadan</hi> is a large Town, but in many places of it void ſpaces, there being many Gardens and Ploughed Fields within the Walls; the Houſes are Stately, yet built of Brick baked in the Sun: It has one fair Street, where they ſell Stuffs and Cloaths ready made; it has many Shops in it, and lies near the <hi>Bezeſtein</hi> which is little, but well compacted; and indeed it is a Town of a pretty Trade, many Caravans coming thither out of <hi>Turkey,</hi> and other parts, to buy and ſell Merchandize, though the Air and Water are unwholſome, and no Wine to be found, ſo that I was very ill there, which made me haſten to be gone to a more agreeable Air. It is Commanded by a Cham, under the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who is the ſame there, as a Baſſa in <hi>Turkey.</hi> The <hi>Armenians</hi> have a Church here, but keep it in no good Order: To this and other Chams the King e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Year ſends a Rich Veſt, who go out of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57084:52"/> Gate to receive it, and return with it on, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Ceremony, then being attended by the chief Men of the place on Horſeback, and this is uſually Cloth of Gold.</p>
               <p>From hence we took Mules with our Lading, for five Abaſis a piece, and one of theſe will carry 600 weight, if need requires it; and ſo taking leave of thoſe of the Caravan that ſtaid to negotiate their Affairs, we ſet forward for <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> the Regal City of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and Metropolis of the Kingdom, in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong Troop; for though ſuch care has been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that Robberies are leſs frequented in <hi>Perſia</hi> than in <hi>Turkey,</hi> yet it is prudence, however, to be armed againſt Danger, and paſſing early in the Morning through the King's Gate, ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it looks towards the Royal City: We Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over Hills and Downs, the way often altering, from good to bad, till we came to the Town of <hi>Niſchar,</hi> where we refreſhed our ſelves in a ruinous Kervanſerai, on the Ground, where Carpets were ſpread, and drank Water out of a leathern Jugg, called there a Matera: From thence we Marched along the River ſide, and came to lodg at another Village called <hi>Boulouſch Kiſar,</hi> and the next Day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped under Trees near <hi>Haran,</hi> another Village, where we were warned by our Muliters, to keep a good Guard in the Night time, for they told us, Spys had been amongſt us that Day, to viſit our Arms, and ſee how we were provided; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they liked them not, or ſtood in fear, I know not; but certain it is, we had there no diſturbance.</p>
               <p>Early in the Morning we marched again, and paſſed by ſeveral pleaſant Villages and Gardens, and foarding the little River <hi>Dizava,</hi> we came to a Town of that Name, lying amongſt Gardens, in a ſpacious Plain, and here we had a plentiful ſhower of Rain, which was the firſt, except a little mizling in our way, ſince my departure from <hi>Aleppo;</hi> and ſo by a long Journey, taking in our way <hi>Sari, Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, Mouchaſaba, Machat, Scheber-Gird, Angovan, Agatch,</hi> or <hi>Farſang, Nichova, Fagaſun, Ithua, Ghul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigan,</hi>

It is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with Walls of a great heighth, built of a red kind of a Marble; and though the Houſes are very Stately, they are built with Brick baked in the Sun, daubed over with a fine Clay, mingled with Straw, and white caſt over with a very fine Plaiſter, which is made of a Stone got out of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mountains and burned to that whiteneſs, this Plaiſter is the third part of the Charge of building a Houſe; they burn their Tiles indeed in a Kiln, but they are not ſo laſting as ours.

               <p>In this City there are many Squares, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it lovely; the greateſt of which, is that of <hi>Mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;</hi> it has regular Piazza's, and is about 700 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Paces in length, and near 300 in breadth; it is built round, and the Houſes are all in the form of Porticoes; over them is a ſecond range of Arches, more backward, and theſe ſerve for Galleries and Paſſages, the Houſes being all of an equal heighth, give a curious Proſpect: There is a pleaſant Canal near it, bordered with Palm-Trees, and fed by a Spring, at the end of which is a Bell, ſaid to be taken out of a Nunnery in <hi>Ormus,</hi> with this Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Ave</hi> Maria <hi>Gratia plena. Hail</hi> Mary <hi>full of Grace.</hi> Hither the Muſicians reſort, there being a Gallery, and ſound ſeveral Inſtruments to divert the People, eſpecially in the Night time, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, a Trumpet of Copper, which is 8 Foot long, making a ſtrong hoars ſound, and may be heard in a ſtill Night all over the City, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in proportion, like a ſpeaking Trumpet,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57084:53"/> Paſſing on to the Right, or Weſt ſide, is the Gate of <hi>Aly,</hi> their great Prophet; on the Threſhold of it, which is a round Stone, the <hi>Perſians,</hi> out of a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for the place, will not tread on; and if Malefactors can eſcape into the Court beyond it, or in the King's Stables, or Kitchin, they are in a Sanctuary, none daring to remove them from thence. This Gate is plain, and guarded by Sofies-men of great account there, and many <hi>Perſians</hi> out of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, kneel and kiſs the Threeſhold e'er they paſs over it.</p>
               <p>The Street of <hi>Techebarbag,</hi> or the four Gardens, is very large, near 100 Paces broad, and about 2 <hi>Itallion</hi> Miles in length: There is a by way into it from the King's Pallace, through narrow Paſſages as it were a Curtain; its watered with a Canal, and adorned with ſhadowing Plan-Trees, being divided by the River <hi>Senderu,</hi> over which is a curious Bridge of Stone, with a Gallery, covered and raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Level for Foot Paſſengers; its about 300 Paces long, and 20 broad, founded on many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſome Brick, edged with Free-Stone, and others all of Stone. Over the Gallery there is a Platform, giving a fine Proſpect of the River, and other places, the Gallery ſerves likewiſe for a Horſe-way in the Winter, for then the overflowing of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fills up the middle of the Bridge, and renders it a kind of a Canal. The Gates of the King's Pallace, and the Front of it, gives a good Proſpect, as do the Moſques, being adorned with Domes, and other Beautifyings; but the Chriſtians are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to enter, under the Penalty of groſs affronts, if not a good Cudgeling, though ſome of them out of curioſity do it in <hi>Perſian</hi> Habits, mingling themſelve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

As for their Burying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places they are without the City, and ſo they are in all the Cities of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:57084:54"/>
               <p> They have a curious way to ſecure the hot Air in ſultry Weather, <hi>viz.</hi> They have on the tops of their Houſes a Wall about 2 Fathom high, and as much in breadth, to which, at the intervals of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Walls of about a Foot broad, and as high as the firſt, are joyned in right Angels, and theſe are covered with a Roof, ſo that let the Wind blow which way it will, the Air being preſſed between 3 Walls, is driven through a hole in the Roof of the Houſe, and diffuſes coolbreathings, cool breathings, but in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this hole is ſtopped.</p>
               <p>This City is full of Artiſts, and each Company pays the King a certain Sum, which they raiſe again upon all the Crafts, and they are very dextrous in their ſeveral Handicrafts, in which, principally, conſiſts the riches of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>In the King's Court the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language is moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoke, but much differing from what is ſpoke at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> this diſtinguiſhes the Courtiers from the reſt of the People, and gives them certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities and Preeminencies they affect, for they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet Honour above all things, and are profuſe in their Diet, Habit, Houſes, and Equipages, which renders many Noble Families Poor. Their Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page in Travelling is extraordinary. They ſmoak much Tobacco, and uſually do it through a Veſſel of Water. Their Games are chiefly Cheſs, and Draughts, which they uſe in their Viſits. There are amongſt them a great many Mathematicians, and Aſtrologers, and the King maintains many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of them liberally, though moſt of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be very ignorant: However, theſe are their chief Studies. They have alſo Dreamers among them, who pretend to ſee and foretel things that way.</p>
               <p>If a Man has killed another, the Widow, or next Relation, demands the ſatisfaction of his Blood, and if it be not made up for Money, the Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, if taken, is delivered to the Proſecutor, who puts him to Death with great Torments, eſpecially if he falls into the Hands of a Woman, for they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57084:54"/> are more cruel here than the Men; and though they often compound, yet the Relations that are not conſenting to it, will privately revenge the Blood of their Friend, concluding, their Honour ſuffers if the Murtherer eſcapes unpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>If any one has been Robbed, he muſt make a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the <hi>Deroga,</hi> who is the ſame in Office, with the Sons, or Sub-Baſſa, in the Turkiſh Government. He ſends his Men abroad to take up ſuſpected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and puts them to the Rack to make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and if the Goods be recovered, he takes a tenth, and ſometimes a ſixth part; but he ſeems to be kinder to the <hi>Franks,</hi> taking only a preſent of them, though may times by concealing the diſcovery, he cheats them of all.</p>
               <p>As for the Habits of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> they are more gaudy than ſubſtantial or laſting, generally waring flower'd Silks, or Callicoes, quilted Coats, and the like, having a flowing looſe Garment over a cloſe Coat, or Waſtcoat, with a Girdle; their Drawers down to their Heels, their Stockings are of Cloth, wide and big; their Shoos are like Womens Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, with high Heels, peaked at the Toes with a bit of Iron, but ſo ſhort, that moſt part of the Heel hangs over, though they ſtick cloſe, and are covered with Shagreen. They ware Turbans very large, and of divers colours, except the Moulla's, who are Priviledged to wear them white, though the <hi>Perſians</hi> ware Caps with little Turbans about them, and the better ſort have them embroidered with Gold and Silver. They take a Pride to have every piece of their Apparrel of a different colour, and affect neatneſs. As for Rings, the Men, nay, the King himſelf wears Silver ones, but the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men thoſe of Gold, though they cannot give any reaſon for this diſtinction. They paint their Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with a Dye, called <hi>Hanna,</hi> and will not ſuffer their Beards to grow long, as the <hi>Turks</hi> do, for they clip them to a quarter of an Inch, and take care to have large Muſtachoes.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:57084:55"/>
               <p> The Women go vailed all to their Eyes, and the Bridegoom never ſees his Bride bare-faced till the Wedding Night. They wear Gold Rings in their Noſes, their Noſtrils being boared for that purpoſe, which is a mark of Servitude, though they take it for a Pride. When they ride, they are placed on a Cammel, in Caſchave, where they are as eaſie as in a Chair. They ſit at their Banquets, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, as the Men do, croſs-legged, on Carpets ſpread on the Ground, or on Cuſhions, and lie on Quilts in their Smocks and Drawers, but have curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fine painted Coverlids over them.</p>
               <p>They eat but ſparingly, and wonder the <hi>Franks</hi> can eat Meat twice a Day, they doing it but once, and then they moſtly Boyl or Bake their Meats, not much approving of Roaſtmeat; nor indeed they do not eat much Fleſh, living moſtly on Rice-broth, Herbs, and Fruits. They burn Oyl of <hi>Napta</hi> in their Lampts, and in Winter have Stoves in their Houſes, which keeps them very warm. They Drink Wine, though they are prohibited it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times do it over plentifully; which makes them, as other Drunkards, quarrelſom. They have a great many Ice-Houſes curiouſly Vaulted, and deep under ground to keep their Ice in, to cool their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors in the hot Seaſons. Many of the <hi>Perſians</hi> take Opium, which intoxicates them in a kind of Drunkenneſs, and they carry it about with them, for having once habituated themſelves to it, they dare not leave it of, for if they do, they have moſt commonly dangerous Sickneſſes, and Death is frequently the attendant.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Perſian</hi> way of Mourning, it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a Girdle, hanging down with 2 ends before, and croſſing them; but on the Death of a near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the Men rend their Caba, or Veſts, in ſign of Grief, and for the ſpace of 7 Days give Alms; but the Women make doleful howlings or lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for ſix, and ſometimes twelve Months, and keep themſelves cloſe, unleſs when they go to viſit the Graves, rehearſing to ſuch as viſit them, the

               <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>The King of</hi> Perſia <hi>an Abſolute Monarch; of the Great Officers of his Court, and other Matters.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE King of <hi>Perſia</hi> has an Abſolute or Deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Power over his Subjects, and anciently, the Kings were in a manner adored by their People: He meddles in matters of Religion, as well as in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Affairs, and they begin not their Feſtivals till they have obtained his leave to keep them; and ſometimes, though the Moon has appeared, he ſets them back, notwithſtanding it is their great Feaſt of <hi>Ramadan.</hi> His Subjects give him great Reverence and Reſpect, and ſcarcely look upon him but with Trembling, paying an implicit Obedience to his Orders. If they ſwear by his Head, the Oath is more binding to them, than when they ſwear by the Deity; and without conſulting the Law, he is the Arbitrary Judge of their Lives and Fortunes, appointing ſuch Rewards and Puniſhments as he ſhall think fit, without controul: And if the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Officer of the Court falls under the King's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, all his Friends forſake him, none daring to own him, or ſubſiſt him with neceſſaries, ſo that he puts to Death whom he pleaſes, and the neareſt Relations of the party are conſtrained to ſeem pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Injuſtice; nay, ſometimes the Sons are commanded to cut off their Fathers Noſes, or to kill them, which order they readily obey. Theſe Kings are ſo jealous of being depoſed, by reaſon of their great Tyranny, that they cauſe the Males of all
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57084:56"/> their Female Kindred, to be ſhut up in a Stone Trough, as ſoon as Born, and there ſtarved to Death. So ſoon as a King comes to the Crown, he puts out the Eyes of all his Male Relations, except Sons. He ſometimes changes Wives with his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, giving them his inſtead of theirs, and it is not murmured at, eſpecially in publick; and if he likes not his Bargain, will exchange again at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>He has a Seraglio of very beautiful Women, who are kept mighty ſtrict, for he is exceeding jealous of them, and it is Death with extream tortures, for any Man, except Eunuches, to be ſeen there; nay, they are prohibited to look on them, though they are Vailed; and when he takes any of them into the Country with him, no Men dare be in the way; and in the Town where he lodges in his Progreſs, all the Men are obliged to leave their Houſes, till the Harum, or Lady is departed; the Eunuches to give them Notice, by crying the Courouk, and if any ſtay after, they are ſeverely puniſhed: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is a Courouk for Proviſion, and then none dares ſell any therein mentioned, but for the King's uſe, and this frequently laſts not above a Week or two. Many times the King lays aſide the ſtifneſs of Majeſty, and is familiar with his Subjects, and Strangers, Drinking and Eating with them in private, but it is dangerous ſpeaking amiſs, leaſt he falls into a Paſſion to the Party's deſtruction, and therefore the leaſt ſaid proves always the beſt; for many have been put to Death for their prating and adviſeing him, which the <hi>Franks</hi> getting Drunk will often attempt to do, when they ſee him ſo familiar with them.</p>
               <p>The King gives Audience to Ambaſſadors, but tranſacts no buſineſs with them, for that is left to the Miniſters of State, and is well pleaſed if they drink luſtily with him, and he has a Remembrancer to tell him the next Day, all that he ſays or does when he is Drunk, for then, many times, he gives away Prodigally, as his Rings from his Fingers, and large poſſeſſions, but if he finds it an over-ſight, or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57084:56"/> too great a value for the Perſon, he recalls it again, and requites the Perſon with ſome little Preſent. He has an Eatmad-Doulet to tranſact for him, as his chief Miniſter, who uſually attends his Perſon. He has always great ſtore of Gold in Plate, and a vaſt Treaſure in Jewels; for the Nobles preſent him in their Order, every Spring, with one rich thing or other, and he poſſeſſes the Treaſures and Eſtates of thoſe he puts to Death, unleſs he pleaſes to give it to their Relations; beſides, the Silks are a Royal Manufactury, and he has great Incomes from them.</p>
               <p>The Forces of the Kingdom conſiſts in three Bands, or Bodies of Men, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Corſchi,</hi> the <hi>Goulams,</hi> and the <hi>Teufencgi,</hi> the firſt of theſe are deſcended of <hi>Turks,</hi> and Inhabit the Country, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Tents, for the moſt part, and are able to make a great Body; there are about 25000 of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the King's Pay, having from ten to fifteen Tomans a Year; their General muſt be of their Body, and is called <hi>Corſchi-Baſſa,</hi> who executes the King's Commands in putting any great Man to Death, for they will not ſuffer the Native <hi>Perſians</hi> to do it. Their chief Riches conſiſt in Cattle, which they drive from place to place, and feed in the vaſt Plains and Mountains.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Rank of Soldiers are Slaves of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations, but chiefly <hi>Georgians,</hi> and about 14000 of them are in the King's Pay, and have from 5 to 8 Tomans a Year; their General is called Koul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Agaſi.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the third Rank are ſuch as are raiſed in the Villages, moſtly <hi>Armenian</hi> Renegadoes, and are about 8000, having equal Pay with the laſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; theſe are of little regard though they March on Horſeback, for in the Battle they alight and Fight on Foot; the other two Bodies Fight on Horſeback, with Bows, Arrows and Harquibuſes.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, there is a new Militia of Guards that bear Muskets, but theſe rarely go into the Field, unleſs the King be there in Perſon. As for the Court-Officers,</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:57084:57"/>
               <p> The <hi>Eatmad Doulet</hi> is as the Viſier <hi>Baſha</hi> in <hi>Turkey,</hi> next to him is the <hi>Sedre,</hi> who manages matters of Religion, and has divers under him; theſe makes all Contracts, Teſtaments, and other publick Deeds, Judges of Divorces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for the <hi>Sedre,</hi> he is the High Prieſt of their Law; there are particularly under him a Scheick of the Law, and a Cidi, or Judge, and theſe are Eſtabliſhed in the Principal Towns of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and are nominated by the King, and only depend upon him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pichnamaz</hi> is an Officer in every Moſque, and in the King's Houſhold he directs the Prayers, and makes the People ſay as he does, and uſe the ſame Jeſtures, always ſtanding before them, that they may not ſee him; there are as many of theſe in <hi>Perſia</hi> as there are Moſques, and they bear a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Authority. The <hi>Mulas</hi> are of the ſame Tribe, living on the Eccleſiaſtical Revenues, and their Buſineſs is to Teach the Sciences and Law, being properly the <hi>Perſian</hi> Doctors, wearing relute Turbans. The <hi>Nuzar</hi> is the Wardrobe Keeper, and Maſter of the Jewels, and is a kind of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer. The <hi>Melitar</hi> is the chief Gentleman of the King's Bed-Chamber, and carrys a Pouch by his ſide full of Hancarchiefs, which he preſents to him as often as he requires them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Deroga</hi> is Judge of Criminal Matters, of the ſecond degree, as Robbery, Quarels, and the like; and under him are the <hi>Aatas,</hi> or Conſtables: There are a great number of other Officers of leſſer Note, whoſe Names and Offices, for Brevities ſake, I am conſtrained to paſs over.</p>
               <p>They Hunt the Antelopes with Panthers, brought up to that purpoſe; this Beaſt creeps on its Belly till it comes near the Game, then runs with main force and leaps at it; but if the Panther miſſes at two or three leaps, he purſues no further, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns creeping back as aſhamed of his being Baffled. They Hawk much in this Country, and the Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons brought from <hi>Muſcovy</hi> are of great Value; they bring them up to fly at the Antelope, by feeding
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57084:57"/> them on the Noſe of a dead Antelope; then flying at the living ones, they faſten on his Noſe, and pierce him with their Beaks and Tallents, flutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo with their Wings, that blinding his ſight, he ſtops, and the Dogs coming up eaſily, takes him. The King keeps for his Pleaſure a great many Lyons, Elephants, Leopards and Tygars.</p>
               <p>To Encourage Chriſtians to turn <hi>Mahometans,</hi> they have a Law that gives them the Eſtates of their Chriſtian Kindred when they dye, though they be in the firſt Degree of Kindred, and the Deceaſed leaves Children; but the Judges for Money have found out a way to invade it, by cauſing them to make it over to ſome <hi>Mahometan</hi> Friend by Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who poſſeſs it in truſt for the Widow and Children.</p>
               <p>They have an odd way to make Women confeſs their Crimes, <hi>viz.</hi> they tye their hands behind them, and then put large live Rats into their Drawers next their Fleſh, which runing up and down, and pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, extort Confeſſions from them; for of all Creatures in the World, the Rat is moſt terrible and frightful to them. As for the Men to bring them to a Confeſſion of their Guilt, their fleſh is pulled off with Pinchers from their Legs, Arms and Thighs.</p>
               <p>When the Sun is Eclipſed, they run to their Moſques, and ſay a Prayer made for that purpoſe, imploring God to avert heavy Judgments from them, and not to leave them in Darkneſs; at the Eclips of the Moon, they beat their Kettle and Braſs Pans, making a Hedious din, perſwading themſelves they help her ſo in her Labour to expell the Darkneſs, which upon the going off of the Eclipſe, her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes her ſeem to ſtrugle with.</p>
               <p>When a Houſe is on Fire, they let it burn out, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving however what Goods they can, ſaying, <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will ſtop it of it ſelf when it ſees ſit;</hi> yet they freely permit others, who are not of their Religion, to endeavour the Extinction of the Flames.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:57084:58"/>
               <p> They hold Chriſtians ſo impure, that if they have touched any Food in the Market, and they know it, they will not buy it; and if one comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Bagnio, the Maſter of it is obliged to waſh it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain before the <hi>Perſians</hi> will enter; yet they own Chriſt ſhall come at the laſt Day, and be <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Lieutenant, and then all ſhall embrace the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Profeſſion, for then <hi>Mahomet</hi> will take a Wife, and have a numerous Iſſue. They hold Marriage in ſo great Veneration, that they blame him becauſe he never was Married. They keep their Feaſts a Day before the <hi>Turks,</hi> for the <hi>Turks</hi> begin not their <hi>Bairam,</hi> or <hi>Eaſter,</hi> till they ſee the Moon, and the <hi>Perſians</hi> do it according to the Moon's courſe, being more knowing in the Celeſtial Sciences. The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Kings are the more Reverenc'd, becauſe they are held to be of the Race of <hi>Aly, Mahomet</hi>'s Succeſſor. The <hi>Perſians</hi> are divided into two Sects, one called <hi>Schiai,</hi> the other <hi>Sunni;</hi> the firſt think it enough to follow the Commands of the Law; but the other do that, and likewiſe obſerve Councils.</p>
               <p>At their <hi>Little Bairam</hi> they Sacrifice a Camel in <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> the King firſt ſtrikes it with a Javellin, and then the People from the four Quarters of the City Aſſemble in a tumultuous manner, and hew the poor Beaſt to pieces, with Swords, Axes, Glaves, and the like, every one ſtriving to get a part of him, ſo that it often comes to a quarrel, and many are killed; the pieces they get they broil and Eat, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it Sacred Meat. In other Cities they kill an Ox in like manner, and in their Houſes many Sheep, which they diſtribute to the Poor.</p>
               <p>In their Creed they have an odd imagination con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Man's dying: They hold that every one muſt come and die in the place where the Angel took the Earth on which he has been formed, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that one of the Celeſtial Spirits has the care committed to him, of forming the Human Creature, by mingling a little Duſt with the Seed of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:57084:58"/>
               <p> They allow liberty of Conſcience to all Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and there are at <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> a great many <hi>Jews, Banians, Guebres,</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> who purſue their ſeveral Tenents. They have a great many Horſes, Mules, and Camels, at all Seaſons, and though theſe things are here ſet down, many of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars may ſerve in General for all <hi>Perſia;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, having been detained in this City too long, I fear, from the intended Travels, I now take my leave of it, to proceed on my Journey.</p>

               <p>HAving ſtayed about 4 Months at <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to viſit <hi>Schiras,</hi> and took the opportunity of a Caravan then ſetting out; we parted early in the Morning and journied South-eaſt, meeting in our way with large Plains very barren; ſome of theſe produced pieces of Salt Earth, made by the Salive part of the Ground, and the working of the Rain on it, and this being refined makes good Salt; leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Plains, we encountered with Hills, very difficult to paſs, becauſe, though not high, they were Rockey, and very Slippery, ſo that many of the Mules caſt their Burthens, which proved very troubleſome to us, and took up much time to reload them; but having paſſed theſe Hills, we came to <hi>Mayar,</hi> a ruined Village, which is the beginning, or entrance into the Country of <hi>Fars,</hi> the real Ancient <hi>Perſia,</hi> and there we lodged in a Kervanſerai, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57084:59"/> going from thence, had, for a good way, a pleaſant Country on either ſide of us, fruitful in Trees and Corn Ground; but meeting with a Chan, and his Harams, or Women, we were forced to fetch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs to give free Paſſage, for theſe great Governors in their Provinces, are as Abſolute as a King, and will have their Commands as ſtrictly obeyed.</p>
               <p>It will be in a manner endleſs, to tell you all the Villages, Hills, Plains, Valleys, and Rivers by their Names, that we paſſed in this long and tedious Journey, therefore, for brevity ſake, in a tired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I haſten as faſt as I can to <hi>Schirars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This City is the Metropolis of the Ancient <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia;</hi> ſome will have it to be the Ancient <hi>Cyropolis;</hi> the Gates we enter'd at were very Fair and Stately, leading to a broad Street, bordered with Gardens, and at the end of it is a large Stone Baſon full of Water to refreſh Travellers; further there is a Bridge with 5 Arches, under which runs a ſmall River, and a little beyond a covered Bazar; and though this Street is very fair and long, it is accounted only the Suburb to the City. It lies in a pleaſant fertile Plain at the Eaſt of it, where is a little Hill covered with Orange and Lemon Trees, intermixed with Cypreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: It lies from North to South, and is about two Hours walk in Circumference. It has many fair Moſques, and a Colledge in it: There are Sallaries allowed to divers Learned Men in the latter, to teach Theology, Philoſophy, and Phyſick, and ſometimes there are 4 or 500 Students in the it: The Gates are laid over with blue Earth varniſhed, ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like Saphires.</p>
               <p>The Gardens are exceeding pleaſant, adorned with Fruits, Flowers, Canals, Fountains, and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-Houſes, on little raiſed Mounts, but many of the Houſes are ruinous, for the <hi>Perſians</hi> are very Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine in repairing decayed Fabricks.</p>
               <p>This is a City of great Trade, in compariſon of many others, by reaſon the <hi>Indian</hi> Merchants bring the rich Commodities of that Country hither. There is a Well of a vaſt depth and circumference, into
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57084:59"/> which they throw Women convicted of Adultery, and there ſuffer them miſerably to Periſh; it is cut all out of a hard Rock. A little diſtant there is a ſtately Moſque, and in it the Tomb of <hi>Scheik Sadi,</hi> an excellent <hi>Perſian</hi> Poet, whom they Honour as a Saint: There is a Well not far from this, and a Stream running under it, full of Fiſh, which none may take on pain of Death, unleſs the Derviſh who looks after it, connive at them, which he will do for a little preſent, and keep off all Spies, by pretending there are Women in the Wells, and then the Men run away as from ſome fearful Monſter. One goes down to it by a pair of Stairs.</p>
               <p>There is much Glaſs made in this City; they make a Glaſs Bottle, called a <hi>Caraba,</hi> that will hold near 30 Quarts, covering them with Cane, or Straw; and here is to be found the beſt Wine in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; they have abundance of Capers, plenty of Roſe-Water, and preſerve Grapes for the whole Year. A Vizar Governs here as the King's Farmer, and pays yearly 1000 Tomans, amounting to 15000 Crowns.</p>
               <p>We ſtayed here but 2 Days, and then ſet out for <hi>Lar,</hi> in our way to <hi>Bender,</hi> and paſſing over Plains, Hills, and Rivers, meeting by the way whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of <hi>Arabs</hi> driving their Cattle, we arrived there. This Town is ſmall, and ſeated on a Rock; it is Commanded by a Chan, who has a ſtately Houſe, with a Divan; it has a fine Market-place, a Bazars, and a Caſtle; the laſt is very ſtrong, and built all of Stone. There are a great many <hi>Jews</hi> inhabit, and drive a conſiderable Trade here; all the Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Lar</hi> is full of Tamarisks that are very large here, and in moſt parts of <hi>Perſia;</hi> the Sparrows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in great numbers, deſtroy and waſt the Fruits of the Earth exceedingly.</p>
               <p>Taking a good refreſhment in this Town, we took our way through a Country much like the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer we had paſſed, ſince our leaving <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> and by tireſome Journeys came to <hi>Bender-Abaſſi,</hi> where we no ſooner entred but were carried to the Cuſtom-Houſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57084:60"/> and had our Goods ſearched; in our way I ſhould have told you, grew poyſonous Plants, of which a ſtrange ſtory goes, <hi>viz.</hi> That if any Man comes near them in <hi>June</hi> ot <hi>July,</hi> when South Winds from the Sea blows upon them, they ſend forth ſuch a poyſonous Vapour, which drawn in with the breath, cauſes the Body all over, to be in a burning heat, and immediately the Party dies, ſo that in thoſe Months the way is little frequented. The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> affirm this for Truth, and call the plants <hi>Kher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zehreb;</hi> but this infection is rather concluded by the Judicious to be in that Wind they call the Burying-Wind.</p>
               <p>This Town is very little, govern'd by a Chan, and is of a prodigious Traffick, as being commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Scituated for Trade; the <hi>Schah Bender</hi> is the chief Cuſtom-Houſe Officer, part of which Cuſtoms belong by right to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by a Contract, when they aſſiſted the <hi>Perſian</hi> King in taking <hi>Ormus,</hi> but they have been much defrauded, and reap lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit benefit. It has only one publick Gate, a Bazar, and a Fort to the Sea-ſide, which is a ſquare Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of about 4 Fathom each Face, and 2 in heighth, there not being above 5 or 6 Port-holes for great Guns; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> have their Houſes by the Sea-ſide, and the proper Flags of the Nations fixed on Poles on the Tarraſſes, to direct Ships thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>About 2 Leagues from the main Land is the <hi>Glory of Iſlands,</hi> ſo termed, <hi>viz.</hi> the famed <hi>Ormus,</hi> at the Mouth of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulf; it is Southward from the main Land, the Gulf reaching from thence to <hi>Baſſera,</hi> which is in the bottom of it. <hi>Ormus</hi> lies in 27 degrees North Latitude, 180 Leagues from <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſora;</hi> it has a Fort that was built by the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> but taken from them by the great <hi>Schah Abbas,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> aſſiſted by the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> The Iſland is no more than 3 Leagues in circumference, and moſtly Rockey, but it has gotten its Fame from the Riches that flowed thither, from <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> as being a conſiderable Mart, eſpecially when the <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:57084:60"/> held it. As for the Water and Proviſions, they are moſtly brought from the main Land, and becauſe there is a deficiency of Springs, they keep rain Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Ciſterns, and little more now is Inhabited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Fort, round which the <hi>Perſians</hi> have cut a Trench, and let the Sea into it by a Canal, for it ſtands on the point of the Iſland, and is the laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Perſia</hi> this way. There are great ſtore of Oyſters about it, about the bigneſs of ours, but much harder to open. A League to the South-weſt is the Iſland of <hi>Lareca,</hi> it is bigger then <hi>Ormus,</hi> but very Barren, the Ground conſiſting of a burning Sand; it reaches in length from North-weſt to South-eaſt: There is little in it except a Fort, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but the <hi>Perſians</hi> fearing they would prove ill Neighbours if they fortified it, took it out of their Hands, and finiſhed it.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Perſia</hi> in General, it is environed with Mountains and Barren Deſarts, which are main Bulworks againſt the attempts of powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Their is a ſcarcity of Money, which is one main reaſon they cannot ſet a great Army on Foot in ſo vaſt a Country: and this, I think, proceeds from the ſmallneſs of Trade, for the <hi>Perſians</hi> are not very induſtrious, all of them ſtanding much on points of Honour. There are few or no Fruit-Trees to be found but in Gardens; and in moſt places the Water is bad, and Wood exceeding ſcarce in almoſt all the Provinces. Their chief Manufacture is Silk, and ſome Stuffs. There is abundance of Liquorice growing almoſt every where, but little of it ſet. The Country abounds in Brooks, which render the ways very bad to Travel in Winter, and ſome Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, moſt of which are in <hi>Mazandara,</hi> whoſe chief is <hi>Eſchref,</hi> and moſt of theſe Rivers fall into the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>Here is the greateſt ſtore of Wood in the whole Country of <hi>Perſia,</hi> but there are a vaſt number of Serpents and Scorpions, who dying in multitudes, during the hot Seaſon, corrupt and infect the Air, rendering it unwholeſome; ſo that in fine, <hi>Perſia</hi> is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57084:61"/> ſaid to be a large Kervanſerai, that ſerves for a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for the Money and Goods that go out of <hi>Aſia, Turkey,</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and to the Stuffs and Spices returning, of which they have a ſmall Profit.</p>
               <p>Deſigning, now I was thus near to v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>A Brief Account of</hi> Aethiopia, <hi>as I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Mounſieur</hi> du Pau, <hi>who reſided many Years in that Court.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BEING now at <hi>Baſſora,</hi> preparing for a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the <hi>Indies,</hi> it will not be amiſs to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you with a brief Relation of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> or the Country of <hi>Abyſſins,</hi> which I had of a <hi>French</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I found here, who had Travelled in that vaſt Country, and lived ſome time in the Court; and this I the rather ſet down, becauſe I know not whether I ſhall ever Travel into that famed Country, yet I ſhall be as Brief as may be.</p>
               <p>He told me it was bounded on the Eaſt by the <hi>Red</hi> Sea, and <hi>Zanguebar,</hi> on the South by <hi>Avouſa, Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ela, Narca, &amp;c.</hi> on the Weſt with <hi>Nubia,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Negros;</hi> on the North with part of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> and <hi>Bugia,</hi> and is about 7 Months Travel in Circuit. The King has four Kings Tributary to him, <hi>viz.</hi> The King of <hi>Senner,</hi> who pays him Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute in Horſes, and lives in an exceſſive hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; the King of <hi>Naria,</hi> who pays him Tribute in duſt Gold; the Kings of <hi>Bugia,</hi> and <hi>Dangala,</hi> who
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57084:61"/> ſends their Tribute in Stuffs and Slaves. In this Country are Mines, out of which Gold is gotten, and ſent to the Coaſts of <hi>Saffala</hi> and <hi>Guinea,</hi> and theſe Mines are ſhallower than in other Countries. They have likewiſe a great deal of Civet, which is ſcrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Teſtacles, or rather from an opening ſlit between or near the Cods of a Civet Cat; this Beaſt is almoſt as big as a midling Grey-hound, with a ſharp Noſe and Head like a Fox; they have Feet, Tail, and Whiskers like a Cat.</p>
               <p>When the People of the Country fall out, they go before their Scheiks, who do the good Office to make them Friends again. They anoint their Heads with a ſtrong Oyl, extracted from the Root of an Herb, to keep them from ſwarming with Lice, which they are very ſubject to. The Provinces of <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> are, <hi>Gouyan</hi> (where the King has a Viceroy) <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handir, Amara, Dambia,</hi> all very Mountainous; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moud, Tygre,</hi> and <hi>Barnegas;</hi> alſo other Provinces de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on it, Governed by Princes who are his Vaſſals. The Air is in ſome places temperate, but in <hi>Senner</hi> very hot. In this Kingdom are 24 Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or Viceroys. The Capital City is <hi>Gonthar</hi> in the Province of <hi>Dambia.</hi> The King has 100 Wives, and yet ſo little Jealous, contrary to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> that he keeps no Eunuchs to look after them, it being counted a Sin in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to geld a Man; He is of eaſie acceſs, ſo that the pooreſt have freedom to make their complaints to him, or ſpeak to him what they are minded: He keeps the numerous Children he has by his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wives, on a Mountain, called <hi>Ouohhni,</hi> 2 days journy from <hi>Gonthar.</hi> On the top of the Mountain there is a pleaſant Cave, where they keep them a Nights, and in the Day time when they are big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, their Guardians let them play about the Mountains. When the King dies, they chuſe one of the wittieſt and likelieſt of them, and Crown him, not regarding Birth-right; then are the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers removed a diſtant place to be kept Priſoners, and his Children as he gets them, ſent to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Mountain.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:57084:62"/>
               <p> The Burying-place of the Kings is called <hi>Ayeſus,</hi> and is a Grot cut out ſquare in a Rock, there the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged are laid on one ſide, and the Younger on the other ſide: and near it ſtood a very pretty Church built by the Jeſuits, but they diving into Politicks, and State Matters, gave ſuch ſuſpition to the King, that they intended to undermine his Throne, as made him baniſh them, and demoliſh their Church and Houſes, puting ſome to Death that lingred behind, as alſo divers Capuchins, ſetting a bag of duſt-Gold on their Heads, which made the <hi>Abyſſins</hi> hunt out, and cut off divers of them, which they ſent to the King, and received their promiſed Reward; ſo that the poor Fathers were forced to pack up and be gone; however, in the place where the Church ſtood, there is a place erected which contains a curious Library, ſtored with Books of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of Learning, in various Languages. This Country produces very good Wheat and Barley, and is pretty Fruitful in moſt places where the Deſarts are not, for there are very great ones in it, of 3 or 4 Days Journey, which are Wavey, like the Sea, when the Wind blows ſtrong from the South, or South-weſt, inſomuch, that Men and Cattle are buried under Mountains of looſe Sand, if they be in the way, where the Deſarts lie moſt expoſed to thoſe Hurricanes.</p>
               <p>The King in his Progreſs, always lodges in Tents, the Houſes of their chief Nobles being very mean, in reſpect of thoſe in <hi>Europe;</hi> and the Walls of thoſe of the meaner ſort are of Mud and Slime. There are almoſt Men of all Trades in this Country; they have no Camels here, but ſtore of Mules, Horſes, Aſſes, and Oxen. The People have an ill cuſtom in eating raw Fleſh, except the King, who has it dreſſed, and drinks Wine of the Grape; the reſt drink a Liquor made of Millet, or Saraſin-Wheat, and they have a Spirit made of it as ſtrong as Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. They have Cloths, Stuffs, and Velvets, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the way of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and are Habited like the <hi>Franks</hi> or <hi>Europeans.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:57084:62"/>
               <p> The King has a Guard of Harquibuſiers. As for their Money, it is pieces of Cloth cut out, going by weight, and little pieces of Salt they cut out on the ſide of the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> The places where they make it is called <hi>Arho.</hi> There is amongſt them the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who have no Fire-Arms, but uſe in War Sphears and Targets, and often make War with the <hi>Aethiopians;</hi> their Riches conſiſting in Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and as this Gentleman informed me, there are a great number of different Languages ſpoken in this Country; and diſcourſing him about the River <hi>Nile,</hi> which has its riſe there, he told me, he had ſeen the ſource of it, and that the Spring riſes in, and iſſues out of a Well in a large Plain, ſhadowed with many Trees, and that well or Spring is called <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vembromma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It riſes in the Province, or Little Country of <hi>Ago,</hi> and is a very pleaſant Water there; from the Spring it runs Northward, through a long tract of Land, and having paſſed ſeveral Cataracts, or falls, which are very high places, with a terrible roaring, it paſſes on ſmoothly till it enters <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and is, as I have elſewhere ſaid, the main ſupport of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for ſhould the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> King turn the Current, <hi>Aegypt</hi> would be little better than a Deſart, which the Grand Signior, as many have gueſſed, fearing, is the cauſe he moleſts not the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> with War; and the reaſon of its over-flowing in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to proceed from the great Rains that fall in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> about that time; for when it is Summer in one place, it is Winter in another. There are but a Mountains any thing near the Spring of <hi>Nile,</hi> and thoſe are called the <hi>Jews</hi> Mountains, becauſe they once inhabited them, but growing powerful, were driven out for fear they ſhould Rebel, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to live in the Plains. Theſe Mountains are exceeding high, for in that hot Country they have always Snow on their Tops or Spires.</p>
               <p>There is a Generation of <hi>Portugueſe</hi> among the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> for anciently the Mooriſh King of <hi>Zeila</hi> forcing a King of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> to fly into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57084:63"/> he implored aid of the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> to reſtore him to his Throne, who, with their Fire-Arms ſlew the Mooriſh King, and ſo terrified his Army, that they left the Country; and for this, their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on the Coaſt, were put into Offices, and had rich Poſſeſſions beſtowed on them, when ſetling and Marrying with the Native Women, their progeny encreaſed.</p>
               <p>The King, and all his People, are a kind of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of the Cophliſh Religion, and believe but one Nature in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> at the end of 8 Days they Circumciſe their Males, and Baptiſe them 14 Days after, their Patriarch depends on him of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi> They ſay Maſs as the <hi>Cophites</hi> do, but their Books are in their own Language. When their Patriarch dies, they ſend to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and that Patriarch ſends them a fit Perſon.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57084:63"/> they declined to tell me, though I afterward under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, they had bought it for 16000 Roupies when it was in a bad condition, and repairing it they put up <hi>Armenian</hi> Colours, and had 3 Paſsports to indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them from the <hi>Europeans</hi> that have Factories in <hi>India.</hi> Our Cargo conſiſted of ſuch things as could not be vended at <hi>Baſſora,</hi> as Indico, Cloth, Dates, Cheſts of Glaſs, Venetian Looking-Glaſſes, and a good quantity of Money to buy <hi>Indian</hi> Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I hired a Cabin, and laid in Proviſion and Water, fearing in ſo hot a Voyage, the latter might grow ſcarce; and it was not without precaution, for ſo it happened. Setting Sail, and getting clear of the Iſlands, we ſteered South-weſt, and had Water, at 5, and 8 Fathom, 2 Men being continually heaving the Lead, leaſt we ſhould fall on Shallows, or Rocks that are under Water near the Shoar.</p>

This Iſland reaches in length, from South-eaſt to North-weſt, is very narrow about 3 or 4 leagues in circumference, and 50 Leagues from <hi>Boſſara;</hi> it is partly Hills, and partly Plains, yielding Grapes, Barley, Wheat, Dates, and good ſtore of freſh Water, which is a precious commodity in thoſe Countries: There are Wells dug on the top of Rocks 10 or 12 Fathom deep, and have Steps to go down, and from the bottom of theſe Wells the Water paſſes, and runs under ground into the Plains. Near to the Wells there is a neat Moſque on the Hill, and on the Iſland is 150 indifferent Houſes, and near it a Pearl Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery.

               <p> Being thus diſappointed, we ſoon weighed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and ſteered away South South eaſt with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gentle Wind, but were ſoon becalmed for many Hours; then ſprung up an Eaſterly Wind, and we ſtood away to the South, and ſoon had the Iſle of <hi>Riſcher</hi> on our Larboard, which is very near the main Land, and makes a little Port, called <hi>Bender-Riſcher,</hi> which is guarded by a Fort, and ſtanding away, we came up with the Iſland of <hi>Coucher,</hi> and left it on our Larboard; this Iſland is large, and indifferent Fruitful; and ſo Sailing on, paſſed Cape <hi>Verdeſtan</hi> at 3 or 4 Leagues diſtance; and as we Sailed, we had often a faint view of the main Land of <hi>Perſia,</hi> eſpecially where it lay high and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous; but before we came to the Iſland of <hi>Lar</hi> we loſt our Long-Boat, which was a great diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lar</hi> is a little Deſart Iſland, bearing nothing but a few Trees at the Weſt North-weſt end of it; we paſſed by this, and the next that preſented was <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dravia,</hi> a little low Iſland near the main Land; and paſſing by we had <hi>Kies,</hi> another Iſland to the South-Weſt; it is indifferently Inhabited, the Houſes ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down in it, but Coaſting <hi>Paloro,</hi> and leaving Mount <hi>Sennas</hi> on the Main Land to the Larboard, we made <hi>Congo,</hi> a little Town in the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia,</hi> 27 Degrees, 15 Minutes North Latitude; it ſtands on the Sea-ſide, near the Foot of a black Rock that ſhelter the Town from the North Winds, and behind there is a white Rock, or Hill, and many ſuch along the Coaſt. The Town lies from Weſt North-weſt, to Eaſt South-eaſt, and is defended by a little Caſtle, where 3 pieces of Cannon are mounted, and has a ſafe Road for Shipping to Ride in, though they are very much toſſed in high Winds, about it are 5 Gardens reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Fruit-Trees, as Figs, Lemons, Quinces, Oranges, Pears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Large Pomgranates, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and Palm-Trees; there are alſo the <hi>Indian</hi> Mangoes; they have <hi>Schiras-Wine,</hi> and Brandy, made of Dates; there are near it Hills, producing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57084:64"/> Sulphur, which is dug and tranſported to the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Cuſtom is eaſie, half of it belonging to the King af <hi>Portugal</hi> by Agreement, beſide five Horſes the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> preſents him every Year; and to this end there is a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Agent reſiding in the Town, who has the Colours of that Nation on the Tarras of his Houſe.</p>
               <p>Leaving this place after the ſale of ſome Goods, and taking in others, we ſet Sail for <hi>Sindy,</hi> being the firſt Town of <hi>India,</hi> where the River <hi>Indus</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges it ſelf into the Sea; but here we narrowly eſcaped falling into the hands of the <hi>Zinganes,</hi> a ſort of <hi>Indian</hi> Pirates, who lie with their Boats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Rocks, to ſurprize Veſſels as they come near them, and if they board a Ship, in the firſt fury, till they have maſtered and ſecured the Prize, they put all to the Sword, and the reſt they Lame, by cutting the Sinew above the Heel, and make them Slaves to keep their Cattle; they ſo uſe them to prevent their running away: Their Arms are only Swords, and Arrows, therefore our watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the fire of our great Guns made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire again among the Rocks, ſo ſoon as they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to attack us. But having little to do here, we ſet Sail for <hi>Surat,</hi> having now on Board us, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in many Paſſengers 116 Souls, and paſſing many ſmall Iſlands, and ſome Promontories came to <hi>Queſchimo,</hi> a large low Iſland, ſo that Sailing by it, one may ſee the Mountains of the main Land over it; it lies from Eaſt to Weſt 20 Leagues in length, but indifferent in breadth. There is a Fort where Ships Anchor at 6 Fathom Water, and this formerly belonged to the <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> On the South Eaſt of it lies <hi>Nabdgion,</hi> or <hi>Pilombo,</hi> a little low De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart Iſland; and Eaſt of it <hi>Tonbo,</hi> affording little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Antelopes and Coneys; but Ships have here the Advantage of many Wells to Water at, yet the entrance is dangerous, becauſe of the Banks that lie under Water about it; the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> were once Maſters of moſt of theſe Iſlands, and exacted Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute from Ships that Traded there, but their
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57084:65"/> Strength and Riches decaying at Home, weakned it abroad, ſo that now they have loſt moſt of their footing on the Coaſt of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sailing from hence, in a little time, we had the Iſle of <hi>Angom</hi> to the North eaſt, and on the South-eaſt a Port of <hi>Arabia Foelix,</hi> called <hi>Julfer,</hi> to which many <hi>Indian</hi> Barks come to buy Dates and Pearl, the latter being fiſhed all along the Coaſt from <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat</hi> to <hi>Babrem,</hi> and bring <hi>European</hi> Money to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe them. The next that ſtood with us were the Iſles of <hi>Salame;</hi> theſe are four Rocks over-againſt Cape <hi>Moſandon,</hi> one of them bigger than the reſt riſing a little into a point, there is a dangerous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel paſſing between them, all Rock at the bottom, ſo that many adventuring to paſs it have been caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>Having paſſed theſe, we met with great ſtorms of Hail, accompanied with prodigious Thunders and Lightning, inſomuch, that the Sea ſeemed to be all on Fire. This made us furl our Sails, and though the Air on Head of us was as dark as Night, there appeared a Rainbow on our Starboard.</p>
               <p>Upon the breaking of this Storm prodigious Spouts began to riſe out of the Sea to our Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and at length, encreaſed almoſt on all ſides of us, ſome being very near, which put us into a conſiderable fright, leaſt falling on our Ship they ſhould ſink it, they being extraordinary large, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that all affirmed they had not ſeen the like in their Lives, ſo that all Hands were employed to ſecure the Ship as well as might be, from the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning danger; for we as good as gave our ſelves to be loſt; however, truſting in the Creator of all things, and taking to my ſelf more Courage than ordinary, I took a view of theſe watery Prodigies: The firſt that appeared was about a Musket-ſhot from us, as we were ſteering North-eaſt, and before it roſe, the Water in that place boiled up prodigiouſly, more than a Foot above the ſurface of the Sea, foaming and looking whitiſh, and over it ſomething repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting a black Smoak (which the <hi>Banians</hi> fooliſhly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57084:65"/> ſaid was the Devil ſucking up Water to drown them.) This made a hurrying noiſe like a Torrent running in a Valley, mixed with a hiſſing like that of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, or Gees. A little after appeared a dark puff of ſteem, this ſeemed to be a Pipe as big as ones Finger, the noiſe continuing, this tapered as it were up to the Clouds, and the light put it out of our ſight, ſo that we knew that Spout was ſpent; but then there was another to the Southward of us, which began in the ſame manner as the former, ſoon after another to the Weſtward, and another to the ſide of the ſecond, the moſt remote of the three; and all theſe appeared like ſo many bundles of Straw, a Foot and an half, or two Foot above the ſurface of the Water, ſmoaking to appearance exceedingly, making the ſame noiſe as the firſt. A little while after I perceived ſo many Pipes reaching down from the Clouds upon theſe Riſings, and every one of them had a large end joyning to the Cloud, wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning like the end of a Trumpet, and the lower end reſembled the Teat, or Dug of a Beaſt, ſtretched perpendicularly down by the force of ſome weight. Theſe Pipes appeared to be of a paleiſh White, which I conjecture was the Water in them, for no doubt they were formed before they drew it up, and being emptied diſappeared; for though the Pipes deſcended ſmall, ſwelled with the Water they grew larger, to the thickneſs of a Man's Arm, or more.</p>
               <p>Theſe Spouts are dangerous things, for falling on a Ship they entangle the Sails, and lift her up, then leting her fall again ſink her if ſhe be ſmall, but if the Ship be too heavy to be lifted, they ſplit the Sails, and emptying a vaſt quantity of Water into her with a violent force, ſink her, and thus I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Ships have been loſt, Sailing in thoſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seas where Spouts are, and ſo going down in a Minute or two, have never been heard of. Some that were on Board brought a large black handled Knife, to cut the Spouts at a diſtance, which Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Fancy is thus put in practice: One of the Ships company kneels down by the Main-Maſt,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57084:66"/> and holding in one Hand a Knife with a black han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, he Reads the Goſpel of St. <hi>John,</hi> and when he comes to theſe Words, <hi>viz. The Word was made Fleſh, and dwells in us,</hi> he turns to the Spout and cuts the Air a thwart, and then they hold the Spout, though at a great diſtance, is cut, and lets down all its Water with a great noiſe. But the Maſter looking on this ſilly fruitleſs Fancy as a piece of Conjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would not let it be put in practice. In the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean</hi> they ſhoot Croſs bar ſhot at them, which hitting is more probable of the two to cut; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, theſe ſpent themſelves without doing us any harm; and at length, through infinite Mercy, we weathered the Storm which raged furiouſly all the time, and kept on our Courſe having the main Land of <hi>Arabia</hi> on our Starboard, and on our Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board that part of <hi>Perſia</hi> called <hi>Marſan,</hi> which bore South-eaſt of us, and we made particularly one Hill of Land ſhaped like a Sugar Loaf; and here, in <hi>November, December,</hi> and <hi>January,</hi> the Eaſt Winds commonly Reign, and therefore to go from <hi>Perſia</hi> to <hi>India</hi> in a ſhort time, the beſt Seaſon is <hi>March, April,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> for then the <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> or Trading Wind blows. However, we held on with the help of the Current, which from the end of <hi>July</hi> to <hi>January</hi> ſets towards <hi>Ormus</hi> from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and from <hi>January</hi> till <hi>July</hi> from <hi>Ormus</hi> towards <hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In our Paſſage another Storm ariſing, we ſaw 3 new Spouts, but they were at too great a diſtance from us to apprehend much dangar. In our way, off <hi>Bembaceca,</hi> we overtook 3 Ships bound to <hi>Surat,</hi> as we were, but proving ſlow Sailers, the Maſter would not ſtay for them, but reſolved to make the beſt of his way, ſo contrary to the mind of the Mate, we left them to Sail at their leiſure.</p>

               <p>AFter many dangers in Coaſting <hi>Perſia,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> we knew by the Snakes we ſaw at Sea, a kind of ſpungy Froth floating in great abundance on the Water, which pricks, and makes the Hands of thoſe that touch it burn, that we were not far from the main Land of <hi>India;</hi> we kept Sailing by many ſmall Iſlands, of which thoſe Seas are plenty, till we made <hi>Daman,</hi> a Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who have ſtrengthened it with a conſiderable Fort: It lies in 20 Degrees North Latitude. From this Town to Cape <hi>Comorin</hi> is a range of very high Hills along the Coaſt, yet this Town has no other Harbour but a little Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel which remains almoſt dry when the Tide is out. Here refreſhing our ſelves, we took the advantage of an Eaſterly Gale, and weighing Anchor bore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Northward, having no more than five Fathom and an half Water in an Hours Sailing; but then coming into deeper Water we Sailed more boldly, and came up with the Bar of <hi>Surat,</hi> in 6 Fathom and an half Water: Here the Cuſtom-houſe-Officers came aboard us, and narrowly ſearch'd and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every thing they had an opportunity to ſee; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Boats came to fetch off the Paſſengers and their Goods, and we were had to the Cuſtom-houſe, and again ſearched in a very odd manner. The
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57084:67"/> entrance for Veſſels of Burthen is very difficult, and we were a ground twice before the Tide could car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us in; we paſſed then by the Caſtle of <hi>Surat</hi> on our Right Hand, and dropped our Anchor before the Cuſtom-Houſe.</p>
               <p>Thus being happily at Land, after a two Months troubleſome Voyage, I and others reſted and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves. The Bar, ſo called, by reaſon of Sands, and is 6 French Leagues or more from <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> yet their Ships of great Burthrn muſt unload before they can come up the River.</p>
               <p>Being impatient to ſee <hi>Surat,</hi> of which I had heard ſo much diſcourſe at home. I went in a Boat on the River with divers other Paſſengers, but by reaſon of the Stream being againſt us, we were a conſiderable time e'er we reached the Town; and the Cuſtom-houſe being open, upon the Signal gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven we came on Shoar, without which we might not do it: then paſſing a large Court, we entered into a Hall, where the Cuſtomer waited to have us ſearched.</p>
               <p>The manner of their ſearching, as I ſaid, is odd, and very ſtrict, they making their ſearch from Head to Foot, feeling your Nakedneſs in every part, looking alſo into your Mouth, as if they would tell you your Age by your Teeth; and the Waiter demands of every Paſſenger, as his Fee, an Abaſſy, which is worth about 18<hi>d.</hi> and the Bark has half a Roupe, which is about 14<hi>d.</hi> a Head for every Paſſenger. If they find one ſmugling in the leaſt, he is fined ſeverely, if not Caved. All the Baggage is brought into the Cuſtom-houſe to be ſearched, and when that is done, every one is called in his turn, to pay, and take them away for Money; they take two and an half <hi>per Cent.</hi> for Merchants Goods, of Chriſtians four, and of the <hi>Banians</hi> five <hi>per Cent.</hi>

                  <hi>India</hi> is a very large Country, of which I ſhall ſay ſomething, before I enter upon particulars. It is bounded on the Weſt with the River <hi>Indus,</hi> on the Eaſt with <hi>China,</hi> on the North with <hi>Tartary,</hi> on
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57084:67"/> the South with the Ocean, and is properly divided into two diviſions, <hi>viz. India intra Gangem,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia extra Gangem;</hi> the firſt contains nine Kingdoms, <hi>viz. Narſinga, Malavar, Ballaſia, Cambaia, Mandao, Bengala, Ariſtan, Comora,</hi> and <hi>Dellia.</hi> The ſecond, ſeven, <hi>viz. Macine, Aracan, Couchin-Chian, Baram, Siam, Pegue, Malavar.</hi> The whole Country ſeems to take its denomination from the vaſt River <hi>Indus,</hi> which runs 1000 Miles e'er it falls into the Sea; and the Empire of the Great Mogul is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, many of the others being petty Kings, ſome of them paying him Tribute, and his Territories are uſually called the <hi>Moguliſtan.</hi> The preſent Great Mogul is held to deſcend directly from the line of <hi>Tamarlan</hi> the <hi>Tartar,</hi> whoſe Succeſſors ſetled in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and took to themſelves the Name of <hi>Moguls,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe to whom that Prince left <hi>Zagalay, Perſia, Coraffau,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries to be Govern'd after him; and they concluding this Name would contribute to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Family, becauſe the People would be the more eaſily perſwaded they are of the Race of the great <hi>Ginguiſcan,</hi> the firſt Emperour of the Ancient <hi>Moguls.</hi> It has been ſucceſſively maintained for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Generations, and is a mighty Empire eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Mogul,</hi> is was anciently the Name of a mighty People Inhabiting a Country at the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of <hi>Eaſt-Tartary,</hi> inclining towards the North, which others have called <hi>Mongul</hi> and <hi>Mongal,</hi> ſome <hi>Moguliſtan,</hi> where <hi>Ginguiſcan</hi> was Born, and that Emperour reduced it wholly under his Obedience, before he proceeded to the Conqueſt of the reſt of <hi>Aſia;</hi> and both himſelf and Subjects were called <hi>Moguls.</hi> The Great Mogul is ſaid to carry 300000 Horſe into the Field with him when he makes War, beſide a conſiderable Army of Foot; yet the moſt knowing <hi>Indians</hi> ſay, though he pays ſo many, there is not above half of them in Arms at once. The great Men that Command, uſually, for their own advantage, it being the moſt they have to live on,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57084:68"/> double the Muſter-Roll. He has in his Dominions, 20 Provinces or Governments, and thoſe that have made them more, have miſtaken, by making two of one.</p>
               <p>The true bounds of his Empire to the Weſt, are, <hi>Macram,</hi> or <hi>Sinde,</hi> and <hi>Candabar:</hi> On the Eaſt it reaches to the River <hi>Ganges;</hi> on the South it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Gulf of <hi>Bengala,</hi> the great Sea, and <hi>Decan;</hi> on the North by a part of <hi>Tartary.</hi> It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends from Eaſt to Weſt, above 400 Leagues, and from North to South 500; and this vaſt ſpace, ſome Mountains and Deſarts excepted, is very much repleniſhed with Cities, Towns, Caſtles, Boroughs, and pleaſant Villages; and the Country about them very fruitful in Corn, Rice, Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Province of <hi>Guzerat,</hi> in this Empire, is the Town of <hi>Surat,</hi> of which I have ſpoke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing already. It lies in 22 Degrees 7 Minutes North Latitude, watered by the River <hi>Tapty.</hi> The Walls were formerly of Earth, but they are fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now of Brick, 2 Fathom and an half thick, and of the ſame heighth, being cautioned ſo to do for its better defence, upon its being plundered by <hi>Raja Savegi,</hi> who made himſelf Maſter of great Riches, though he took not the Caſtle, nor was able to force the Factories of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> who had Fortified them with Cannon, and making a ſtout defence, ſaved their Goods from the ſpoil. This <hi>Raja</hi> had his Government in the Mountains, and did great miſchiefs in <hi>India;</hi> though <hi>Aurenzeb,</hi> the Mogul, or Emperor, did all he could to prevent it.</p>
               <p>In building the new Wall, a great many Houſes are left out of the Town, eſpecially thoſe built of Cane. When the Mouſſon, or Monſon, a Wind that ſerves for Trade of Shiping, blows, the Town is full of People, ſo that 'tis difficult to get any Lodging: and this is in <hi>January, February, March,</hi> part of <hi>April,</hi> and ſometimes all that Month.</p>
               <p>It is Inhabited by <hi>Indians, Perſians, Arabians, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians, Turks, European</hi> Chriſtians, and ſome few other Nations; though the proper Inhabitants are
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57084:68"/> divided into 3 Orders; the firſt of theſe include the <hi>Indian Moors,</hi> and others of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the ſecond are <hi>Gentils,</hi> or Heathens, who adore Idols, the third are the <hi>Parſis,</hi> who are likewiſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Guares,</hi> or <hi>Artechpireſt,</hi> adorers of Fire, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Religion of the ancient <hi>Perſians;</hi> and theſe retired into <hi>India,</hi> when <hi>Caylif Oman</hi> reduced <hi>Perſia</hi> under the Power of the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> The <hi>Banians</hi> are here the richeſt Merchants, ſome of them being held to be worth 8 Millions of Crowns. The <hi>Dutch</hi> particularly, among other <hi>Europeans,</hi> have driven a great Trade here, as did the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and theſe had Houſes aſſigned them for their Factories, called Lodges, very neatly built.</p>
               <p>The Caſtle is built on the ſide of the River <hi>Tapty,</hi> and is a Fort of moderate bigneſs, and of good ſtrength; it ſtands at the South end of the Town, and defends the Entry againſt thoſe that would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack it. It is ſquare, and flanked at each corner with large Towers: The Ditches on 3 ſides are filled with the Sea Water, and the 4th which is on the Weſt, is waſhed by the River. In this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle the Mogul's Revenues gathered in the Province are kept, and never ſent to Court without Order.</p>
               <p>On the Weſt ſide there is a ſtately Gate to enter at, which is in the <hi>Bazar</hi> or <hi>Meiden,</hi> and this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle has a particular Governor, and the Town has another. The Houſes of the Rich are but meanly built, of Timber, Brick, Lime, and Tiles, and moſt of theſe being fetched a great way renders building very dear, by reaſon there is no Stone in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: They make their Laths of Bambous Cane, and they chuſe, by reaſon of the exceſſive heat of the Sun, which drys and craks ſo faſt, to build when it Rains, rather than in dry weather. As for the Houſes of the ordinary ſort they are made of Cane, and covered with Palm branches. The Streets are large and even, but not Paved. They ſpare the Oxen here to Till the Land, and carry Burthens, feeding on Cow-Beef, eſpecially for the moſt part; they have good Mutton, and abundance
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57084:69"/> of Poultry, and eat with their Meats the Oyl of <hi>Cnicus Sylveſtris,</hi> or wild Saffron, the beſt in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> alſo that of <hi>Seſamum,</hi> which is common, but not ſo good. They have white and red Grapes there, but they make an eager and unpleaſant Wine, becauſe the heat is ſo exceſſive they have not delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration enough to ripen; nor is the ſtrong Waters drunk there much better; it is made of <hi>Jagre,</hi> a a kind of courſe black Sugar diſſolved in Water, with the bruiſed Bark of the Baboul-Tree, and ſo Diſtilled.</p>
               <p>They make ſtrong Water likewiſe of Tary, and draw a Brandy from Rice, Sugar and Dates, which, however, is but very ſorry ſtuff, and kills many of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> who coming a long Voyage, too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly faſten on thoſe Liquors and drink intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately. They infuſe theſe ingredients likewiſe in Water, and by ſetting them in the Sun make Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Surat</hi> are ſold all ſorts of Stuffs and Cotten Cloth that are made in the <hi>Indies,</hi> likewiſe a great many <hi>European</hi> Commodities, and thoſe of <hi>China,</hi> as Purceline, Cabinets, and Coffers, adorned with Turquois, Agats, Cornelian, Ivory, and all ſorts of Embelliſhments; here are Diamonds, Rubies, Pearls, and moſt ſort of precious Stones that are found in the Eaſtern Country; alſo Amber, Musk, Myrrh, Frankincenſe, Manna, Sal Armoniac, Lac, Indico, Quick-ſilver; the Root Raenus for Dying Red, and all ſorts of Spices and Fruits that are to be found in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and other Countries of <hi>Levant;</hi> and here Merchants buy up Drugs to tranſport into all parts of the World; ſo that this Town, though not large, may be ſaid to be the Emporium of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having pretty well viewed this place, and taken ſuch things as I was informed were neceſſary for ſuch hot Countries as remained for me to Travel in, and conſidering <hi>Amedabad</hi> was the Chief City of <hi>Guzerat,</hi> I directed my Journey to take a view of it. This Province, a few Ages ſince was an entire King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57084:69"/> Govern'd by <hi>Mudafer,</hi> a young Prince, who by the advice of his Guardian, called in <hi>Mogul Ech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> to make his party good againſt the great Men who were troubleſom to him; but the Mogul get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtrong footing, impriſoned him and his Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, where they died miſerably, and ſeized the Kingdom, annexing it as a Province to his Empire, and it is the pleaſanteſt of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> though not the largeſt, for it is well watered with the Rivers <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabad</hi> and <hi>Tapty,</hi> with ſome other Rivers of leſſer Note, ſo that the Fields look green all the Year, by reaſon of the Corn and Rice that cover them, and the various kinds of Trees that continually bear Bloſſoms and Fruit.</p>
               <p>Setting out from <hi>Surat,</hi> with ſome others in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I Travelled Northward, and 2 Hours after croſſed the <hi>Tapty</hi> in a Ferry, as I did the River <hi>Kim,</hi> near the Town of <hi>Beriao,</hi> and came to <hi>Oucliſſer,</hi> and paſſing the River <hi>Nardabad,</hi> arrived at <hi>Baroche,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Surat,</hi> and the Sea, about 10 French Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, or 20 <hi>Indian</hi> Coſſes, which is a meaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them of about half a League. This Town lies about 22 Degrees North Latitude; it has a large ſquare Fortreſs ſtanding on a Hill, and the Town lies upon the ſide, near the Foot of it, looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the River <hi>Nardabad,</hi> encompaſſed with a Stone Wall 2 Fathom high, flanked with Towers between 30 and 35 paces diſtant one from another, and is the ſtrongeſt in the Province. The <hi>Bazar,</hi> or Market-place is a large Street at the Foot of the Hill, where are made the Cotton Stuffs, called Baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas. Here are Moſques and Temples of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, with Pagods or Idols in them, to whoſe ſenſeleſs Shrines they pay devout Adoration. Here are plenty of Agats, and alſo a bundance of Peacocks.</p>
               <p>Leaving this place, I continued my Journey Northward, and came to the little Town of <hi>Sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> 7 Leagues from <hi>Baroche,</hi> and croſſing the Brook <hi>Dader,</hi> and ſeveral little Villages, I entered <hi>Debea,</hi> where a barbarous ſort of People Inhabit, who, a few Years ſince fed on Man's Fleſh, ſelling it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57084:70"/> at their Shambles, ſo that Strangers always go armed here for fear of being robbed and miſchief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, which made us make but a ſhort ſtay; but paſſing the Lake, or River <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> we came to <hi>Peſnad,</hi> about 7 Leagues from <hi>Debea,</hi> and ſaw in our way 2 great <hi>Tanqueze,</hi> and a number of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies, who came and croſſed us in the Road, fearleſs of our ſhouts, but rather mockingly anſwered us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, crying <hi>Pou, Pou;</hi> the Tanquiez are ſtanding Ponds, or reſervatories for Rain Water, paved at the bottom, and kept very choicely. Leaving this place I Travelled with my Company to <hi>Souſentra,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Mader,</hi> which place is very Woody, and there the Monkies were in greater numbers than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the Fields, Roads, and on the Trees; and Travelling 5 Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gues from this place, I came to <hi>Gilbag,</hi> where I met a great many <hi>Collies,</hi> a People of the caſt off <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who wander up and down, and have no fixed Habitation; their chief buſineſs being to pick the Cotton Wooll. In <hi>Gilbag</hi> there is a handſom Garden that belongs to the Mogul, and in it are kept a number of Peacocks: it is fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Watered, and well Planted with Fruit-Trees, and from hence it is two Leagues to <hi>Amedabad,</hi> to which I went the next Morning.</p>
               <p>This, as I ſaid, is the chief City of the Province, and is about 86 Coſſes or h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lf French Leagues from <hi>Surat,</hi> and the Sea. It is Govern'd by an <hi>Omra,</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Lord, under the Mogul: It lies 23 Degrees and ſome Minutes North Latitude, on a lovely Plain, and is watered by the River <hi>Sabremetty,</hi> which when the Rains fall, much overflows the Plains. There are large Gardens, encloſed with fine Brick Walls; theſe Gardens have reſervatories for Water, and each of them a fine Pavillon at the entrance, and at the end of moſt of them there are conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Lodgings. The Houſes in the Suburbs are ſcattering, and many ancient Tombs are to be ſeen about the City, into which you enter by a ſtraight large Street; the Walls are pretty ſtrong, compoſed of Stone and Brick, flanked with great round Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57084:70"/> and Battlements. It is about a League and an half in length, and has 12 Gates, which are ſtrictly watched, for fear of a ſurprize from the <hi>Raja,</hi> of <hi>Bandour,</hi> whoſe Territories are near, but almoſt in inacceſſible Mountains, which gives him an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to make inroads thereabouts, and ſafely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire with much Booty, not regarding the Mogul. In this City are many curious Arches, and large Squares. There is a Kervanſerai in the <hi>Meidan,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with curious Balcony-Lodgings, ſupported with Pillars; and the King has a Pallace in this City of curious Work, where the Muſicians reſort to Play on their Inſtruments Morning, Noon, Evening, and Midnight, for which they have a Sallary allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; in the Apartments there are ſeveral Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Folages covered Gold; there is the <hi>Juma, Meſgid,</hi> or <hi>Fridays,</hi> whither on that Day the People all Flock; it is very beautiful, and is the faireſt of all others, though there are many more; on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of each Gate is a fine Steeple, with a Balcony, where the <hi>Mueſins,</hi> or Bedles, with their thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Voices call the People to the Moſque, for in this Country they have no Bells; and when they repair hither they appear very devout, for I ſaw above 400 <hi>Faquirs</hi> who held their Arms croſs behind their Heads without ſtirring all the Prayer-time. I viſited ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Moſque which had been a Pagod Temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Aureng-Zebe</hi> cauſed a Cow to be killed in it, which cauſed the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to forſake it. It has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Figures of naked Women in it, ſitting after the Oriental faſhion, as alſo, of Men, Beaſts, and Monſterous Creatures; but they are ſomewhat disfigured by their Noſes being cut off, which <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reng-Zebe</hi> cauſed to be done out of a pretended Zeal. which raiſed him to the Throne over the Heads of his Father and two elder Brothers.</p>
               <p>In this City is the place where the famed Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian was Buried, whom many of the <hi>Indians</hi> hold for a great Saint, and viſit his Tomb with great Devotion: It is a ſquare pile of Building, having on each ſide ſeveral little Domesſetting off a great one
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57084:71"/> the middle. The entry into it is by 7 Ports that take up the whole Front; the Pavings is Marble, the Doors are of the ſame, inlaid with Chriſtal and Mother-Pearle: The Tomb is like a bed, covered with Cloth of Gold, and over it 7 Canopies of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent coloured Silk, one higher than another: The Pavement is uſually ſtrowed with white Flowers, which the devout <hi>Mahometans</hi> bring when they come to ſay their Prayers at the Tomb.</p>
               <p>Near to the Burying-place of the Ancient Kings of <hi>Guzerat,</hi> which is a very fine Building, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arched Vaults under it, where the Aſhes of the Dead are in Urns, is the Sepulcher of a Cow, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Dome, ſtanding on 6 Pillars, but either they knew not, or declined to tell me the reaſon why ſhe was buried there, but at another place I heard, one of their Kings was driven out by the People, who flying to the Mountains, was there ſupported by the Cow's Milk till he was recalled, whereupon dying ſoon after, he left a Pention to keep this Cow ſo long as ſhe ſhould live, with Commands, that ſhe ſhould be Buried in this manner when ſhe Died; and the People on certain Days go to the Sepulchers of their Kings to bewail their loſs.</p>
               <p>The next thing I viſited, was a famed Well, 8 Story deſcending, every Story ſupported with Arches and Pillars; it is 4 Fathom broad, and about 24 long; very lightſome, having in it curious Springs. They ſay it was built by a King's Nurſe, and coſt 20 Millions of Roupies, but I believe a great deal leſs finiſhed it.</p>
               <p>Though ſome may think it ſtrange, and ſcruple crediting it, yet certain it is, here the Gentile <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> have an Hoſpial for ſick Beaſts, and another for Birds, which they feed and look after till they are well, and then they ſell them to their own Sect, but not <hi>Mahometans,</hi> whom they count Cruel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they miſ-uſe and kill Creatures, and often they buy them out of their Hands at dear rates, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of a charitable compaſſion to ſave the poor Creatures Life, for they hold it a Sin to kill any
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57084:71"/> thing. Near this City are large Forreſts, in which they take Panthers, and the Governor has thoſe that teach them to be tame and tractable, and then he ſends them to the King as preſents to divert him in Hunting. I ſaw likewiſe a Beaſt there that had the Head of a Coney, the Ears, Eyes and Teeth of a Hare, the Muzzle round and Fleſh coloured, the Tail of a Squirrel, in the fore Feet it had four Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and a Claw in the place of the Fiſt; the hinder Feet had 5 Toes, each of which were long as well as the Claws; the ſoles of its Feet flat, and like an Apes, of a Fleſh colour; its Hair on the ſides, long, courſe, and of a dark red, but greyiſh on the Belly, like the Wool of a Hair; and from Head to Rump, about a Foot and an half long; few could tell what to make of it; they told me it was brought from <hi>Moca,</hi> yet, probably, it was no other than a Squirril. The Commodities moſtly traded for here are, Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets, Skins, Taffatas, Tapeſtries, with Gold, Silk, and Woollen Grounds, Cotton, Cloth, Indico dried and preſerved, Ginger, Sugar, Cinamon Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, Mirabalans, Cumin, Lac, Saltpetre, Opium, Honey, and ſome Schites, or painted Cloth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cambay</hi> being in this Province, by the Sea, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to viſit it, but on my way found little worth mentioning. Let it ſuffice then that I arrived there. This Town lies at the bottom of a Gulf of the ſame Name, which is very dangerous for large Veſſels to come in, by reaſon of the Flats, and banks of Sand, and for thoſe of leſs force by reaſon the <hi>Malabar</hi> Pirates lie ſheltering under the Rocks to ſurprize them. This Town is much larger than <hi>Surat,</hi> tho' not near ſo Populous, for the cauſes I mentioned. The Walls are Brick, about 4 Fathom high, with Towers at certain diſtances. The Streets are large, and have all Gates at the ends of them which are kept cloſe ſhut at Night. The Houſes are very high, built of Bricks baked in the Sun, and the Shops are ſtored with Aromatick Perfumes, Spices, Silks, Stuffs Ivory, Bracelets, Agat, Cups, Caphlets, and Rings: The Agats are got out of a Quarry, near
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57084:72"/> a Village called <hi>Nimodra,</hi> about 4 Leagues from from <hi>Cambaya.</hi> Moſt part of the Inhabitants are <hi>Banians</hi> and <hi>Raſpouts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Caſtle where the Governor reſides is large, but not beautiful. In this Town there are ſo many Monkies, that ſometimes the Houſes are covered over with them, as it were a Dovecot, and theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Creatures never fail to hurt one or other in the Streets, if they can find any thing to throw at them. There are many Gardens about this Town, and a ſtately Marble Tomb is to be ſeen very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and the Building about it ſuitable, adorned with Porphery Pillars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are the Ruins of other old Tombs to be ſeen near it, held to be thoſe of Ancient Kings. The Suburbs are near as big as the Town, and great ſtore of Indico is made there. As one Travels from this place there is great danger of Robbers who lie concealed, and by a ſlight throw a nooſe about a Man's Neck, pull him down, and ſtrangle him in a trice, and ſo rifle him, and therefore it is proper to go in a good company, though there is a cuſtom to carry a <hi>Techeron</hi> Man and Woman with them, who declare to the Robbers, that the Party is under their Protection, and if they injure them, the Man proteſts to cut his own Throat, and the Woman ſhows them a Raiſor, with which ſhew vows to cut off her Breaſt, and this they ſay, has often deter'd the Thieves from offering violence to Travellers, becauſe the Heathens who are moſtly the Robbers, look on it as a horrid and unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crime to be guilty of the Death of a <hi>Techeron,</hi> becauſe, ever after, the Party who is the cauſe of it is hated by his Caſt, and turned out of the Tribe, and continually upbraided with the Death of a <hi>Gentil,</hi> though I could not underſtand this takes now adays, for few of them will kill themſelves, though they proteſt it, but have a cunning fetch to excuſe it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, after they have whiſpered with the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they have compounded, and ſo get Money out of Chriſtians, which no doubt they ſnack be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:57084:72"/>
               <p> This Province has ſeveral other conſiderable Towns, as <hi>Goga,</hi> on the other ſide the Gulf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 20 and 30 Leagues from <hi>Cambaye, Patan</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more Southward, towards the great Sea, where many Silks and Stuffs are made: It is defended by a Fort, and has a Fine Moſque in it, which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly an Idol Temple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diu,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> fortified with 3 Caſtles, at the Siege of which, an Army ſent by the laſt Sultan but one of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> named <hi>Campſon Gaurus,</hi> periſhed, and Sultan <hi>Solyman</hi> the great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſending another Army under <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi> Baſſa, which was joyned by a vaſt power of <hi>Indians;</hi> the valliant <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Governor named <hi>Siveira,</hi> ſo well defended it, that after a long Battery, they were forced to raiſe the Siege, and leave their Tents, Artillery, and Ammunition, with 1000 wounded Men in their Camp, though the <hi>Turks</hi> in their Paſſage, had ſeized <hi>Aden</hi> by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and ſtrangled the King of that place. At <hi>Diu</hi> is made the Stone <hi>Cobra,</hi> ſo famous for antedot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the biting or ſtinging of Serpents; it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the Aſhes of a burnt Root, mingled with a kind of an Earth they get under the Rocks, and making theſe into a Paſte, they form the Stone of it; then they prick the Wound, and letting a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Blood out, they apply the Stone, leaving it till it falls off of it ſelf; it has the ſame effect on Wounds made by Poyſon'd Weapons, and after that put into Womans, or Cows Milk, it leaves the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it has ſucked in, and if it be not ſo uſed, it will burſt.</p>
               <p>There are two other Towns of Note in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, <hi>viz. Nariad,</hi> and <hi>Mamadebad,</hi> where they make ſtore of Stuffs; the latter furniſhing this, and adjacent Provinces, with Cotton Thread. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of this Province to the Mogul's Treaſury is accounted Twenty millions and five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand French Livres yearly.</p>
               <p>Travelling on, I entred the Province of <hi>Agra,</hi> which I reckoned the largeſt in the Mogul's Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57084:73"/> 
                  <hi>Agra,</hi> which gives it the Name is the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Town in it. It is diſtant from <hi>Surat</hi> 210 Leagues, and is ſeated on the River <hi>Gemna,</hi> in 28 Degrees and an half, North Latitude. The River has its ſource in the Mountains to the North of <hi>Dehly,</hi> and increaſing by the way, it is here conſiderable, and paſſing through large Countries, empties it ſelf into the great River <hi>Ganges,</hi> at the Town of <hi>Halbas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mogul <hi>Ecbar</hi> made <hi>Agra</hi> a City, it being before but a Borough, and eſtabliſhing the Seat of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire there, called it <hi>Ecbar Abad,</hi> or the Habitation of <hi>Ecbar,</hi> joyning ſeveral Villages by other Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to enlarge it: He fortified it very well with a Caſtle and Walls of great heighth and ſtrength, and had his Pallace in the Caſtle, containing 3 Courts with Porches, adorned with Gilding and Painting; nay, ſome pieces plated with Maſſy Gold. There are many ſtately Sepulchers, Baths, Pillars, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of great Antiquity. And here <hi>Aureng Zebe</hi> Impriſoned <hi>Cha-Gehan,</hi> his Father, when he mounted to the Throne, and in that confinement he died, who has a little Sepulcher erected to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. There are in <hi>Agra</hi> a great many Chriſtian Families; ſome reckon 5000, but the computation is not agreed on. The <hi>Dutch</hi> hold a Factory in this Town, and for the greater encouragement of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, the <hi>Fourſdar,</hi> an Officer in the nature of a Sheriff, is obliged to make reſtitution to thoſe that are Robbed, and this is punctually obſerved in all, or moſt of the Provinces.</p>
               <p>Here are Elephants, Antelopes, Leopards, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beaſts that they uſe in their Games for fighting. I ſaw here Green Pidgeons, and the <hi>Indians</hi> have a cunning way to catch them in the Water, for they go into the Rivers Naked, and keep their Bodies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Water, their Heads only remaining above, which is covered with a Cap of Feathers in the Form of a Water-Fowl, ſo without ſcaring them, draw them under Water by the Legs.</p>
               <p>In the Mountains, about 5 days Journey from hence, they Hunt, and take ſtore of <hi>Merovers,</hi> or
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57084:73"/> wild Cows, of which Hunting they make great advantage. Their Pictures in <hi>Agra</hi> are pretty well done, but moſtly in bandy Poſtures, exceeding Active, being purpoſely drawn to ſtir up lacivious deſires, and therefore I ſhall paſs them over. The <hi>Agrians</hi> are the beſt Workmen I ever met withal in working Gold on Agat, Chriſtal, and other brittle things, which few of our Lapidaries, or Goldſmiths can do, or if they can, fall ſhort in equalling them.</p>
               <p>Paſſing from <hi>Agra,</hi> I came to <hi>Fetipour,</hi> once the Seat of the Empire, but now not much conſiderable, except for its lovely Meidan and Moſque; the entry of <hi>Ecbar</hi>'s Pallace, and ſome ſtately Pillars ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and down; it was ſlighted, as they ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the Springs about it were brackiſh, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome. I was informed, in this Province there are upwards of 3400 Towns and Villages, of which, next to what I have named, theſe are the Chief, <hi>viz. Bernzabad, Chitopour, Bargant, Mirda, Hindon, Ladono, Chalaour, Byana, Canova,</hi> and <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbade,</hi> moſt of theſe produce Manufactures of Stuffs, Silks, Tapeſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Revenues of this Province mount very near to that of <hi>Guzerat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next we entered the Province of <hi>Dehly</hi> by difficult ways, becauſe the Rains had made the Rivers ſwell in many places. It bounds on <hi>Agra</hi> to the North; and <hi>Dehly,</hi> the Principal Town of the Province is about 45 Lergues from <hi>Agra,</hi> and Mogul <hi>Cah Gehan,</hi> and <hi>Aureng Zeb,</hi> made it the Royal Seat of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; the way is all along planted with curious Trees in a Line, and each half League is marked with a kind of a Turret, and there are convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by the way for Travellers to ſhelter and reſt in: There is by the way likewiſe, an ancient Heathen Temple, viſited by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who provide ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for a great many Apes that are kept there, and they pay a kind of a blind Devotion to them, as the Creatures of the Pagods. <hi>Dehly</hi> ſeems to be compoſed of certain Villages, and there is the Ruins of a Town, which the <hi>Indians</hi> ſay, was the Regal Seat of King <hi>Porus,</hi> famed in Hiſtory for the Wars
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57084:74"/> he maintained againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. There is to be ſeen a Piramid or Obelisk of Stone, with an Inſcription in very ancient Characters, which they ſay, <hi>Alexander</hi> erected in Memory of his Victory over <hi>Porus,</hi> but the Character not being <hi>Greek</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it doubtful.</p>
               <p>This City lies in an open Champion Country, waſhed by the River <hi>Gemna,</hi> it has a Fortreſs half a League in circumference, with a ſtrong Wall, and a round Tower, every 10 Battlements being ſecured by a Ditch wharfed with Stone, and a Garden round it. In this Fortreſs the Mogul holds his Pallace, and keeps the Enſigns of his Royalty; and from hence he beholds the fighting of Elephants, and other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes at Land, as alſo on the River; and towards the Town is a large place where the <hi>Rajas</hi> in the Mogul's Pay Encamp, as his Guard. The Market is kept in a fine Square, where abundance of Juglers, and Fellows pretending to Conjuration, ſhew Tricks. All the Mogul's Attendance in the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is a ſtately Hall, wherein he gives Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Miniſters about affairs of State, and thoſe of his Houſhold; and in this Pallace is a Throne of Maſſie Gold, ſet with Flowers of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Emerald, Rubies, and other precious Stones, and a Peacock made out in all its Colours, with Gold, Silver, and precious Stones, inſomuch, that it reſembles the Life, and is of vaſt value: They ſay theſe were begun by <hi>Tamarlan,</hi> and finiſhed by two ſucceeding Moguls: Some hold theſe to be worth 20 Millions of Gold.</p>
               <p>There is a ſtately Moſque, with its Dome of white Marble, and the Karvanſerai of <hi>Begum Saheb,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Cah Gahen,</hi> and Siſter to <hi>Aureng Zeb.</hi> There are two extraordinary fair Streets in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

               <p>They have Elks and Rhinoceroſes here that are as large as Oxen; they have many Bufflers, and they breed up Dogs brought from <hi>Bengala,</hi> who are held to have been originally brought from <hi>England,</hi> for their paſtime in hunting Lyons, and other furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wild Beaſts.

Some ſay they worſhip the Moon, becauſe they have been found kneeling, and throwing up Herbs and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at its Change; and uſually about that time they waſh themſelves in Rivers, if they have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians,</hi> as well as the <hi>Moors,</hi> often kill them in the Mountains for their Teeth, they having two exceeding large ones: Some are found Dead with their Trunks off a good way, and this misfortune happens to them when they go to Water at <hi>Ganges,</hi> or <hi>Indus,</hi> which Rivers are peſtered with huge Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles, who bite off the ends of their Trunks, when they dip them in the Water, and ſo the poor Beaſt is ſtarved for want of wherewithal to feed it ſelf.

               <p>The Town of <hi>Azmer</hi> is walled with Stone, and has a good Ditch about it; without it there appears the Ruins of many ſtately Buildings that ſhew great Antiquity; in the Town is to be ſeen <hi>Cogea-Mondy,</hi> a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Saint; it is a curious Building, having three Courts paved with Marble, the firſt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly large, and hath on the ſide ſeveral Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of pretended Saints, with a reſervatory of Water, and a neat Well about it; the ſecond is not ſo large, but much more beautiful, and many Lamps burning in it; the third is more beautiful than the reſt, and therein is <hi>Cogea</hi>'s Tomb in a Chapel; the Doors of it are adorned with various Colours made into Flowers, and other curious Devices with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Pearl: There are other Courts and Lodgings for the Imans or Prieſts who read the Alcoran, and many go a Pilgrimage from far Countries to this Tomb. The common Building of the Town, as all over <hi>India,</hi> is but indifferent, yet there are many particular pleaſant places in it.</p>
               <p>There is a great Feaſt held every New Years day, and a Fair kept by the Ladies of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the beſt Quality, who expoſe their Jewels, Cloth of Gold, and other rich Things to Sale, and indeed themſelves, for the wittieſt and handſomeſt uſually get Husbands, if they be not Married be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They have a ſumptuous Feaſt at the Mogul's Charge; and he is preſented by them, the great Men, and their Ladies, with a vaſt deal of Treaſure, and in the ſeveral Provinces whilſt this Feaſt holds, he has ſeldom leſs than 14 or 15 Millions given him. There are curious Shows of Elephants, Fireworks, and other pleaſant things to divert them; and when he is preſent with his Begums or Princeſſes, he lays aſide the ſtifneſs of Majeſty, and is very familiar
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57084:76"/> with his Nobles, returning them Preſents, but of no great Value in ſome parts of this Province, and very ordinary in others. The <hi>Indian</hi> Girls are Married at 8 or 9 years old, and have uſually Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at 10: Thoſe of the more ruſtick ſort go na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, except a Rag to hide their Privities.</p>
               <p>They have a Beaſt here no bigger than a Hare, which has on its Belly a ſwelling, or Bladder, that fills with corrupt Blood, which being taken off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes pure Musk, but the Beaſt lives not long after it. They uſe Oxen for moſt ſort of Labours, as to ride on, carry Burthens, draw in Coaches, Carts, Chariots; the white ones are eſteemed the beſt, and bear an extraordinary price.</p>
               <p>They make ſtore of Salt-Petre in this Province, which is done in this manner. They dig a fat black Earth, and put it into Pits, mingling it there with Water, and beating it with great Wooden Beaters, ſo let it ſtand till the Water has imbibed the ſaltneſs, then they draw it off in Pots, Reſine and Boyl it till it Rocks, and being dried in the Sun, they ſell it to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> who carry it home as Ballaſt, and vend it at good Rates. This Province is held to pay the Mogul between 30 and 33 Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions a Year, by way of Tax and Cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>Departing from hence moſtly through a Country indifferent Fertil, and watered with ſome ſmall Branches of Rivers, I entered the Province of <hi>Sinde,</hi> or <hi>Sindy,</hi> which by ſome is called <hi>Tatta,</hi> bounded with <hi>Azmar</hi> to the Eaſt, and the Mountains that border partly belonging to one Province; on the North with <hi>Multan;</hi> on the South with a Deſart and the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea; and on the Weſt by <hi>Macram</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtan:</hi> It reaches from South to North in length, on both ſides the River <hi>Indus,</hi> and the Orientals call that vaſt River <hi>Sinde,</hi> or <hi>Sindy.</hi> On the Banks of it was fought a Famous Battle, between <hi>Ginguiſcan</hi> firſt Emperor of the <hi>Tartars</hi> and the Antient Moguls, and Sultan <hi>Gelaleddin,</hi> which alotted the Empire to the former, in his gaining a Victory wherein 200000 Men were Slain, ſo that he utterly van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57084:76"/> the <hi>Caezmian</hi> Princes, who had for a long time been Maſters of <hi>Perſia,</hi> all <hi>Zagatay,</hi> and the greateſt part of the Country of <hi>Turqueſtan.</hi> This River runs 1000 Miles, and receives many other Rivers into it; its Banks are thick of Towns, but there is no great ſtore of Fiſh in it, by reaſon of the Allegator, or Crocodiles that deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>The chief Town in this Province is <hi>Talta,</hi> though there are ſeveral others of Note and Trade, as <hi>Died,</hi> or <hi>Diub-ſind,</hi> it lies between 24 and 25 Degrees North Latitude. At <hi>Talta,</hi> particularly, there is a great Trade, where the <hi>Indian</hi> Merchants come from all parts to buy up the Goods made there, the Inhabitants being very ingenious in all kind of Arts. The great River mentioned, makes many Iſlands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this place which are very Fruitful, but little Inhabited, yet renders the Town very commodious, were it not for the great heat that reigns there in the Summer Seaſon.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Lourebender,</hi> 3 days Journey from this Town upon the Sea, there is a fine Road for Shipping, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reckoned by many the moſt commodious in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which cauſes a great Trade, where the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanquins of <hi>Talta</hi> are vended, being the neateſt in <hi>Indoſtan.</hi> The beſt and neateſt Chariots and Coaches made in <hi>India</hi> are found here, though the <hi>Indians</hi> Travel in Palanquins, which are a kind of Couches with 4 Feet, having on each ſide Balliſters, 4 or 5 Inches high, and at the Head and Feet a back-ſtay like a Childe's Cradle: This Machin hangs by a long Pole, called Pambou, by the means of 2 Frames nailed to the Feet of the Couch, theſe Frames have great Rings, through which Ropes paſs, and alſo the Pole or Pambous, and ſo the Planquin is carried on Mens Shoulders, who ply for that end for a ſmall matter. Theſe Machins are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry richly adorned, every one doing it after his own humour, as he is able; ſome with Tiſue, others with Cloth of Gold, or rich Embroidery; for as the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> are generally Neat, ſo they are moſtly Proud, taking a delight to ſhow their finery to Strangers.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:57084:77"/>
               <p> The other Provinces of the Mogul's Empire are, <hi>Multan, Candahar, Caboul</hi> or <hi>Cabouliſtan, Cachmir</hi> or <hi>Kichmir, Lahors, Ayoud</hi> or <hi>Haoud, Varad</hi> or <hi>Varal, Becar, Halabas, Ouleſſer</hi> or <hi>Bengala, Malva, Candich, Balagate, Doltabud, Telenga,</hi> and <hi>Baglana;</hi> but theſe, and ſome others in <hi>India,</hi> not under the Juriſdiction of the Great Mogul, for want of an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and an indiſpoſition I had, by reaſon of the intemperateneſs of the Air, upon often chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Climates, not giving me leave to take a ſtrict ſurvey of them, I hope the Reader will pardon ſome Omiſſions, and be pleaſed to gueſs at them by what I have ſaid of many in particular, ſince as to Trade, People, Building, Manners, Cuſtoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vary, only I ſhall ſay ſomething of the Famous River <hi>Ganges,</hi> and then conclude my Travels in this Torrid Country, with General, but very Material Obſervations.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ganges,</hi> as well as <hi>Indus,</hi> is a vaſt River, full of pleaſant Iſlands, covered with lovely <hi>Indian</hi> Trees, which delight the Paſſengers for 5 or 6 days Sailing. The Heathens, or Gentils, <hi>Indians,</hi> eſteem the Water: They have Temples, and Pagods near it, and here have a freedom of Worſhip; the chief Pagods are that of <hi>Jaganat,</hi> which is at one Mouth of the <hi>Ganges,</hi> and that of the Town of <hi>Bonarous</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the River; theſe are ſuperſtitiouſly decked with Gold and Jewels; Millions of People repair thither, and Feſtivals are kept for many days together, when they carry their Idols in Triumph.</p>
               <p>The Great Mogul drinks commonly of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Ganges,</hi> though many affirm, that if it be not boiled it cauſes a Flux. This River having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a vaſt number of Brooks and Rivers from the North-eaſt and Weſt, diſcharges it ſelf by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Mouths into the vaſt Gulf of <hi>Bengala,</hi> at the heighth of about 23 Degrees, and this Gulf begins in 8 Degrees North Latitude, and is reckoned 800 Leagues over: On the ſides of it, to the Eaſt, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Towns, belonging to divers petty Princes, who are Sovereigns, with whoſe Subjects, as well as the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57084:77"/> Moguls, the <hi>Europeans</hi> Trade for rich Commodities. On the banks of the <hi>Ganges</hi> are Herds of Deer, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, but the Crocodiles deſtroy many of them by pulling them into the River when they come to Drink, and then devour them: I ſaw a Negro Boy pulled under by one of them as he was Swiming, but ſaw him no more. The Ships that Moar in the River where theſe moſt haunt, keep Guard by Night to prevent their clambering on the Decks, and ſurprizing the Men a ſleep.</p>

               <p>The Marriages of the <hi>Mahometan Indians,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of Note, are celebrated with Pompous ſhows, and much Magnificency; they are Married by a Moula, or <hi>Mahometan</hi> Prieſt, and then the Bride in rich Ornaments, is carried to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's Apartments on an Elephant. The Females Marry very young, as at 8, 9, and 10 years of Age, and ſome ſooner, but thoſe that Marry early leave of Child bearing at 30, and are very much wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The Wedding Ceremonies of the <hi>Gentil Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> is this; the Bramen, or Prieſt, after having ſaid
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57084:78"/> ſome Prayers over the Couple, puts a Cloth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and orders the Man with his naked Foot to touch the naked Foot of the Woman, and ſo the Ceremony is compleated. The Women are very Fruitful in this Country, and eaſily Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>As for Aparrel, they wear Cotton, Stuffs, or Silks, as looſe of they can; the Man has Linnen wraped round his Head, like a little cloſe Turban, and the Woman a kind of a Carchief, though their Habits, according to the Caſts, are various, yet of as many Colours as they can have them.</p>
               <p>They often do Pennance by Abſtinence, and ſome are put in a hole for that purpoſe. where, they ſay, they remain 6 or 7 Days without Eating or Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but this is moſtly in the Temples of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods, of which they have numbers, many with vaſt Labour being cut out of natural Rock, ſome like Men, and others very Monſtrous: And in ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces great Hills and Rocks, with prodigious coſt and pains are cut into ſuch Forms or Shapes, which ſhews their Superſtition.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bengala,</hi> and other places, they Sacrifice to the Sea, throwing in Coco Nuts, which little Boys ſwim for, and make much ſport and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Caſts, or Tribes of the <hi>Gentil Indians,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coned to be 84, and though they profeſs to be all of the ſame Religion, yet they differ migntily in their Ceremonies.

They are generally very Charitable, eſpecially to Strangers in their Sickneſs or Diſtreſs, and will ſtreighten themſelves very much to relieve them. The Bramens, who are their Doctors, make the firſt and head Tribe.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:57084:78"/>
               <p> The Mogul's Birth-Day is kept with great Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Rejoycing, and then he is publickly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Golden Scales, and precious Stones tied up in bags are the Weights: The Weight of him is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred, and if that Year he weighs more than the former there is great Rejoycing; and for Trifles he gives amongſt his Nobles and Favourites, he receives a vaſt Treaſure in Preſents; if he weighs leſs, they conclude him to be Languiſhing, which abates much of their Merriment, and that Day particularly, the <hi>Indian</hi> Women adorn their Ears and Noſes with Rings and Jewels, if they are forced to borrow them, though at other times the better ſort wear them; thoſe they wear in their Ears are flat, either of Gold, Silver, or Copper.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Indians</hi> they have a Liquor called Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is the Juyce of a Palm, or Coco Tree, or rather the Sap, which they love ſo much, that in many places the Women make it in their bargain before they are Married, that they ſhall be allowed to Drink it, and to go abroad ſometimes to ſee their Neighbours: It is gotten by wounding the Trees, and taſts ſomething like Whitewine. The Coco Nuts are about the bigneſs of an ordinary Mellon, and are very much eſteemed for the Liquor they produce. The <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Batavia</hi> have a Market kept under theſe kind of Trees, and the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Shade brings them in a great income for Standings, beſide the advantage of the Fruit. As for the Swords, Daggers, and other Arms of the <hi>Indians,</hi> except Bows and Arrows, they are heavy and clouterly made, after the ancient Faſhion of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> There are in <hi>India</hi> many Hermophradites, partaking the Genitals of both Sexes; theſe, though they go in Womens Aparrel, wear a Turban on their Heads to diſtinguiſh them, under a great Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty.</p>
               <p>As for the belief of the <hi>Indian Gentiles,</hi> it is, that every Man may be ſaved in his Religion or Sect, provided he exactly follow the way that God has directed him, affirming, when they bow to Idols,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57084:79"/> they worſhip them not, but have God in their Mind; they ſay thoſe that take ill courſes will be Damned, and doubt not, but their Religion is the firſt of all Religions, and that it was eſtabliſhed in the days of <hi>Adam,</hi> and preſerved by <hi>Noah,</hi> believing that there is a Heaven and a Hell, for Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, but none ſhall enter before the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Judgment: That they ſhow Honour and Reſpect to a Cow, becauſe ſhe affords them more ſubſiſtance than other Creatures. The <hi>Pythagorian</hi> Doctrine or Opinion of Tranſmigration of Souls is held by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Caſts, which makes them refrain killing Beaſts or Birds, leaſt the Souls of ſome of their Tribe, departed, ſhould be in them, and they often reſcue them by purchaſe from the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who are about to kill them.</p>
               <p>They call their God <hi>Ram,</hi> and ſay he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of the Light, and in that conſideration, they render him Divine Honours in their P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gods, and elſewhere. In ſaluting their Friends they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat his Name twice; their Adoration conſiſts in joyning their Hands, as if they Prayed and letting them fall very low, then gently raiſing them to their Mouth, and laſt of all, over their Heads. They ſay <hi>Chitta</hi> was <hi>Ram</hi>'s Wife, and when they ſee the Picture of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> they affirm it is <hi>Chitta</hi>'s Repreſentation, ſaluting and bowing very low to it, bringing Offerings of Fruit, Oyl, and Wax-Candles, for none of their Sacrifices are Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but conſiſt of bringing to their Pagods, things of Ornament, and ſuch as may be Eaten, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Bramen's Directions they anoint the Body of the Image with Oyl and ſay their Prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Idol they intend to Invocate, they preſent their Oblation, and return out of the Temple, and when the Bramen has taken what he thinks fit, the reſt is diſtributed to thoſe of any Religion that will come for it. Beſides the Bramens, the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> of <hi>Porphyrus</hi> are the Prieſts, and Doctors of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Indians.</hi> But the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have a Mufti, and here I omit their Opinions, as being ſpoken of elſewhere.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:57084:79"/>
               <p> They have many ſtrange Ceremonies in the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of their Dead; they firſt waſh them in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter near the Temple of ſome Pagod, and then in ſome places ſiting uncovered in a Chair, is carried with beat of Drum to a Funeral Pile, attended by the Wife, and the Relations, in the richeſt Attire, and after the uſual Abſolution, it is laid on the Pile, and the Wife who had followed in Triumph, has a kind of a Throne ſeated there, in which ſhe places her ſelf, adorned with Gold, Jewels, and Silver of her own, and lent her by her Friends, ſeeming wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die, ſinging and rejoycing, that pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

This, by the wiſe, is looked on as a piece of Prieſtcraft, to get the Riches that are found in the Aſhes, as Gold, Silver, and ſuch Jewels as reſiſt the Fire, for the Aſhes being accounted Sacred, none but the Bramen has the medling with them; and the Woman is counted Infamous among her Caſt that refuſes to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo this Cruelty.</p>
               <p>Some are buried with their Husbands, up to the Neck, then ſtrangled and quite covered; and ſome of the Maids, for the love they bear their Miſtriſs, will in like manner accompany her in Death; but this is rarely uſed now, for the Mogul, and other <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes of <hi>India,</hi> have ſtrictly forbid it, as Inhuman, and Barbarous, which ſecures many Women from the Infamy they would otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo in their Caſt; yet though the Governors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend all that in them lies to reſtrain it, ſome are ſtill burnt, for by earneſt Sollicitations, and large Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, if the Wife Petition for it, which ſome of them do, leave is obtained; but it is thought they are incited to it by the crafty perſwaſions of the knaviſh Bramen, who promiſes them ineſtimable Joys and Pleaſures in another Life.</p>

               <p>IN our Paſſage to <hi>China,</hi> for brevity ſake, I ſhall not be particular in every thing I ſaw, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remarkable in ſuch wild and deſart Countries. Let it ſuffice then, that ſetting out we paſſed over vaſt Plains, Rivers, Mountains, and Rockey ways, in danger of wild Beaſts and Robbers, there being but few, and thoſe inconſiderable Towns, till we came to <hi>Athec,</hi> where recruiting with Proviſions, and refreſhing ourſelves, we Travelled on in much the like ways to <hi>Paſſaur,</hi> and ſo by ſeveral ſmall Towns till we came to a City called <hi>Capherſtam;</hi> the Country it ſtands in is very Fertil, producing good Wine, and one thing I obſerved, that they go to their Temples in Mourning Weeds; and 25 days Journey from this, we came to <hi>Gtrideli,</hi> in 20 days more to <hi>Cabul,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Ciracar,</hi> and <hi>Paroua,</hi> the laſt Town in the Mogul's Territories, after which we were often forced to pay Tribute to petty Princes
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57084:81"/> that govern'd the Cities and dependancies in our way. Then to <hi>Aingharan</hi> we journied over exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high Mountains, and leaving that place, came to <hi>Calcia,</hi> then to <hi>Gialalabath;</hi> here recruiting, we paſſed to <hi>Talhan,</hi> and <hi>Cheman</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marhan,</hi> and by a troubleſom way from thence, came to <hi>Badaſciam,</hi> and <hi>Chiarchiumar,</hi> where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted for ſome time, and then kept on our Journey to <hi>Serpanel,</hi> and ſo entered the Country of <hi>Sarcil,</hi> full of Villages, and in 6 days paſſed over <hi>Ciecialith,</hi> a vaſt Mountain covered with Snow, in which Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſome of the company periſhed with Cold, and in a tedious Travel attained <hi>Tanghetar,</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Caſcar,</hi> and paſſing <hi>Jaconich,</hi> came to <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> the Royal City, where, for a good Sum, the Maſter of the Caravan obtained the King's Paſſport to further our Journey more quietly: Then we kept our Journey through <hi>Jocil, Hancialix, Aleghet, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabateth, Egriar, Marcetelec, Thalec, Horma, Thoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tac, Mingrieda, Capetalcol, Zelan, Sarc, Guebedal, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſci, Monſerſec, Ciacolo,</hi> and <hi>Aſcu;</hi> we paſſed theſe by a very tedious way, over Stones, Sands, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts of <hi>Carcatha,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Oitocarach, Gazo, Caſcia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, Dellai, Seregabedal, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngan,</hi> and <hi>Cucia,</hi> then to <hi>Pucian,</hi> and <hi>Turphan,</hi> a Fortified City; thence to <hi>Aramuth,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Camul,</hi> the laſt City of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ciales,</hi> and from <hi>Camul</hi> to the North Wall of <hi>China,</hi> through which we had admiſſion at a place called <hi>Ciaicum,</hi> after a 6 Months Journey, and ſo paſſed to the City of <hi>Socive,</hi> and thus being entered <hi>China,</hi> I ſhall proceed to ſpeak of it, as far as I could learn, during my ſtay there.</p>
               <p>As for the vaſt Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> it has gone under many Denominations, as the Princes has been pleaſed to new Name and call it, as they ſeverally aſcended to the Throne: Under the Reign of the firſt King it was called <hi>Tae mim que,</hi> that is, <hi>The Kingdom of great Brightneſs,</hi> and by ſeveral other Names. But when the <hi>Tartar,</hi> whoſe Race are now in the power, Conquer'd it, they called it <hi>Tai Ciroque, A Kingdom of great Purity;</hi> and ſince it was called
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57084:82"/> 
                  <hi>Chin,</hi> to which the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> the firſt <hi>Europeans</hi> Trading there, adding an A, it has ſince amongſt us been called <hi>China,</hi> and ſo it is generally accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>It is ſeated in the extremities of <hi>Aſia</hi> towards the Eaſt, and lies under 20 Degrees from North to South from the Fortreſs of <hi>Cai Pim,</hi> placed on the Frontiers of the Province of <hi>Pekim,</hi> in the Latitude of 41, to the Meridional point of the Iſland of <hi>Hai nan,</hi> in 8 Degrees of the Elevation, and to the South of the Province of <hi>Quamtum,</hi> ſo that according to the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> account, it is from North to South 5750 Li or Furlongs, which make 575 French Leagues, at 25 to a Degree; and from <hi>Po</hi> point, a Sea-Port Town in the Province of <hi>Che-Kiam,</hi> to the extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Province of <hi>Suchven,</hi> in a ſtreight Line from Eaſt to Weſt it is 426 French Leagues, though Geographers taking it another way, make it much longer, <hi>viz.</hi> from the laſt place to the North-weſt of the Province of <hi>Leaotum,</hi> called <hi>Caiyven</hi> to the laſt City of the Province of <hi>Yunnan,</hi> called <hi>Cin-tien-Kiu-min-Fat,</hi> and ſo the length is accounted 750 French Leagues, and the breadth taken from <hi>Tam Chan,</hi> the moſt eaſterly place of the Country of <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otum,</hi> joyning to the Kingdom of <hi>Corea,</hi> to <hi>Tum-tim</hi> to the Weſtward of the Province of <hi>Xenſi,</hi> it is 500 French Leagues.</p>
               <p>This vaſt Kingdom, or Empire, contains 15 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, larger than ſome conſiderable Kingdoms, moſtly Rich and Fertile, which are ranked accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Antiquity and Precedency, in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the <hi>Chineſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pekim, Nankim,</hi> now called <hi>Kiam-nan, Xenſi, Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, Ho-nan, Xanſi, Chekiam, Kianoſi, Huquam, Su Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, Fokien, Quamtum, Quamſi, Yunnan, Quei Cheum,</hi> and <hi>Xantum;</hi> many of theſe have Towns commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly on the Sea, and others on great Rivers and Lakes, the whole Country being plentifully water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by which means it is exceeding Fertil, and ſaves them abundance of Land Carriage.</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:57084:82"/>
               <p> The <hi>Chineſes</hi> brag much of the Original of their Kingdom, and ſome of their Books place it many thouſand Years before the Creation of the World; but moſt agree, it has preſerved its form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during the Reign of 22 Families, and from them have deſcended 236 Kings, during the ſpace 4034 Years, for ſo long they allow it to have been a Kingdom; yet there is amongſt them another more probable account, <hi>viz.</hi> This account reduces the beginning of it to about 400 Years after the General Deluge, and if any pretend to diſpute it by Writing, or word of Mouth, it is enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger their Lives, for they look upon it as a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to their Kingdom, as being the proudeſt, and moſt conceited People of all Nations, thinking themſelves the beſt in the World, and that all others are inſignificant to them, making in their Maps <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> very ſpacious, and other Countries like little Rocks in the Sea, and they hold a firm opinion, that <hi>Europe</hi> is no more than 2 ſmall Iſlands; they alſo hold, all their Neighbours for <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and paint them in Monſtrous and Ridiculous Forms, and to make them ſeem Cowards, though they have often experienced them to the contrary, they report and paint them as little Pigmies, who tie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in bundles when they go abroad, leaſt the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles and Kites ſhould carry them away; and when any one argues learnedly to them, they ſtart, as in a ſurprize, demanding whether they have their Books in their Country, and when the Strangers Anſwer no, they reply, why then how came you by that Learning? They hold their Religion the pureſt and ancienteſt of all the Religions in the World; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is to be believed, that their Chronicle is the ancienteſt that is to be found, and is ſo well connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Reign of one King hanging ſo well to the other, that it cannot reaſonably be ſuſpected to have been Written upon truſt, by Conjecture, or Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>They divide the Heavens into 28 Conſtellations, and <hi>China</hi> into ſo many parts, allowing each part
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57084:83"/> one, and leave none for any other Nation; and in brief, they give their own moſt lofty and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Titles, but to Foreign Countries, moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſcornful, and degrading Names, to exalt their Kingdom by the diſparaging others, which Pride I am apt to believe proceeds from their Ignorance, though ſome of the Nobles are more moderate and diſcreet, but then it is ſuch as have Travelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, though but a few of them are permitted, and even theſe dare not ſpeak much in the praiſe of other Countries, leaſt they ſhould be looked on as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuers of their own, and conſequently as Enemies. Some of their Kings have had the vanity to ſtile themſelves Child of the Sun, and Emperor of the World. They are, however, a very induſtrious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as appears by their vaſt and ſtately Edifices, Manufactures, and other curious Matters, for there are no idle People in the Kingdom, the Lame, Blind, and Deaf employ themſelves in one buſineſs or other, as they are capacitated, and get a living by it, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they have a Proverb, which ſays, <hi>There is nothing in</hi> China <hi>caſt away;</hi> and let it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo vile, it may turn to Profit one way or other in the City of <hi>Pekim,</hi> which is the chief of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Many thouſands of Families live only by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and ſelling Card-Matches, and Wicks for Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and as many by what they pick up about the Streets. They have in every City a Bell, and a Drum-Tower, on which Watchmen ſtrike, to give the Hours, and the quarters in the Night-time, and both the Drum and Bell are exceeding large, being heard many Miles, anſwering one another in a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Harmony. They burn an Incenſe made of Sweet Woods and Perfumes in their Chambers, and before their Pagods, making Candles of the ſame and other mixtures, which in burning caſt a fragrant ſmell; and ſome they make ſo large to place in their Temples before their Idols that they will continue burning 20 or 30 Days and Nights, and burning to certain windings and marks, they, by that, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Hours and Days, in burning ſuch and ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57084:83"/> proportions; and thoſe that burn them in their Chambers, when they would riſe at a certain Hour, tie a little Braſs weight by a String to a mark that ſpecifies the Hour, and the ſtring burning, the weight falls into a braſs Baſon ſet under it, and ſtrikes like a Larum-Watch.</p>
               <p>They have many other curious devices, as Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots that will run ſwiftly without Horſes, only a Man that ſits in it turning a Winch, which by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Springs turns the Wheels round with great Rapidity. But paſſing over things of this Nature for the preſent, I will proceed to deſcribe, in ſome meaſure, the City of <hi>Pekim,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> where the King has his chief Court.</p>
               <p>This famous City is ſeated in a Plain, forming a vaſt Square, each of its ſides being 12 <hi>Chineſe</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs in length; it has 9 Gates, 3 upon the South ſide, and 2 upon each of the other ſides: it is now Inhabited by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and their Troops are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the 8 quarters, or, as they call them, Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But conſidering, under the preceeding Kings, the numerous Inhabitants had not a ſufficient place to contain them, though the Nine Suburbs anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Gates were as big as Cities. There was a new City built like the old one, ſquare in Form, having its North ſide joyning to the ſide of the old one; this has 7 Gates, and every one a Suburb an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to it, ſo that taking that in, with the Suburbs, it is of a vaſt circumference, yet many who have writ of it, have made it much larger than it is; the one and the other are divided into 5 Juriſdictions, or Tribunals, of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. The principal Streets run to the 4 direct Points, or Winds; they are long, ſtreight, and broad, ſo well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as if they had been marked out with a Line. The little Streets run all from Eaſt to Weſt, being very fair, and divide the ſpaces between the great Streets into equal and proportionable Iſlands, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each a particular Name, and there is a Catalogue to be ſold of them, with Notes and Directions, that Strangers, and thoſe whoſe buſineſs it is to go on
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57084:84"/> Errands, may the eaſier find them, for they are very numerous.</p>
               <p>The faireſt of theſe Streets is called <hi>Cham gan Kiai,</hi> or the Street of Perpetual Repoſe; it is about 30 Fathom broad, and of a vaſt length: The Houſes are low built, which, they ſay, is done in reſpect to the King's Pallace, that it ſhould appear more magnificent, though beſides the King's, there are Pallaces belonging to the Nobility very ſtately, yet they are built backward, ſo that nothing but a great Gate appears to the Street. The old and new City are crouded with ſwarms of People, as the Shops are with ſtore of rich Commodities, ſo that one would ſuppoſe there was a continual Fair held in it.</p>
               <p>The King's Pallace is ſeated in the midſt of the City, and Fronts towards the South, as almoſt all others do in this Country; it is encompaſſed with a double encloſure of Walls, in form of a long ſquare; the outward encloſure is extraordinary high and thick, plaiſtered on both ſides with a curious red Plaiſter, and covered with a ſmall Roof of varniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Brick of a Gold Colour; the length of it from South to North is 8 <hi>Chineſe</hi> Furlongs; it has a Gate in the middle of each ſide, compoſed of 3 Portals, the middlemoſt never being opened but when the King paſſes, and theſe have a Guard upon them, but not very conſiderable; there are alſo many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants kept in a ſpacious place for ſervice, and to divert the King, where are Stables compleatly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for them, and no Perſons that have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable deformity are ſuffered to enter the Pallace; the inner Wall that immediately incloſes the Pallace is very thick, and high built, embelliſhed with well contrived Battlements, and extends from North to South 6 Furlongs, and a Furlong and an half in breadth, and the Pallace is about four Miles three quarters in circumference; it has 4 Gates with large vaulted Arches, thoſe to the South and North being like to them of the firſt Incloſure, and upon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of the Walls are 8 Towers of an extraordinary
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57084:84"/> bigneſs, and good Architecture, Varniſhed with beautiful red, and adorned with Flowers of Gold, covered with Tiles of a Gold Varniſh, and there are Guards kept in them all, except <hi>Madarin</hi>'s of the Tribunals within the Palace; and the Officers of the King's Houſhold are forbidden to come within this Wall, unleſs they ſhew a little Table of Wood, plated with Ivory, wherein their Names, and the places they ſerve in are ſet down, with the Seal of the Mandarin to whom they belong. It has a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious More round it full of Fiſh, and every Gate a Draw-Bridge, unleſs the South, which lies over an Arch. In the vaſt ſpace between the two Walls are many ſtately Palaces that might ſuit the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great Kings, they being richly adorned with polliſhed Stone, and curious Gilding.</p>
               <p>On the Eaſt ſide cloſe by the Wall runs a River, over which are ſeveral Bridges of Marble, with Draw-Bridges in the middle of them: On the Weſt where the ſpace is large, there is a lake full of Fiſh, 5 Furlongs and a quarter in length, made in the Form of a Baſs-Viol; where it is narroweſt there is a very beautiful Bridge which anſwers the Gates of the Wall, at the end of which ſtand Triumphant Arches of 3 Arches a piece, very Majeſtick, and of excellent Workmanſhip. The Lake is environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with little Pallaces, or Houſes of Pleaſure, partly on the Water, and partly on the Land; and on the Lake are many beautiful Barges for the King's uſe; the remainder of the Eaſt and Weſt ſpaces not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by the Lake, are beautified with Palaces, and the Officers Houſes, all very Stately and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, as alſo of thoſe of Artificers that belong to the King's Pallace.</p>
               <p>The inward Pallace is low built, according to the faſhion of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> containing many Pallaces, or Courts, one within the other, ſo that it ſeems a little City of Pallaces, guarded by a great number of Turrets, or Towers; and particularly in the King's Apartment is to be ſeen nothing but gilded Cielings, Pillars inlaid with Ivory and coſtly Stone;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57084:85"/> his Throne is exceeding Rich and Magnificent, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at many Millions, by reaſon of rich Stones and Gold that adorn it: There are alſo ſome Temples erected within this encloſure, and ſo many other things, that it would require a Volume to deſcribe them particularly.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Temples in the Pallace, the King has 7 others, in which he Sacrifices once a Year, <hi>viz.</hi> 5 in the New, and 2 in the Old City, very large, and exceedingly beautified with Gold, and coſtly Paintings. In the firſt of theſe called <hi>Tien-Tam,</hi> or the Temple of Heaven, he Sacrifices to Heaven at the time the Sun comes to the Winter Solſtice, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Hogs, Oxen, Goats, and Sheep, which is done with great Solemnity and Humility, the King laying aſide his Golden Robe, yellow Veſture, and precious Jewels, and putting on a plain Habit of Black, or Sky-coloured Damask. The ſecond Temple is called <hi>Ti-Tam,</hi> or the Temple of the Earth, and here the King before he is Crowned, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to the God of the Earth, and then putting himſelf into the Habit of a Ploughman, he Ploughs a little piece of Ground with a varniſhed Plough, drawn by 2 Oxen with gilded Horns, and in the mean time the Queen and her Ladies dreſs him a homely Dinner, which they Eat together. To the North of theſe ſtands another Temple, called <hi>Pe Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-Tam,</hi> or the North Temple of Heaven, he Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices at the time of the Summer Solſtice, and at Vernal Equinox he Sacrifices in a Temple to the Eaſt, called <hi>Ge-Tam,</hi> or the Temple of the Sun, and at the Autumnal Equinox, at the Weſtern Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, called <hi>Yue Tam,</hi> or the Temple of the Moon; and to prepare for the Sacrifices, there is a Faſt held in <hi>Pekim</hi> for 3 days, during which time, no Fleſh nor Fiſh is to be eaten, under great Penalties; and this they ſay they do in a thankfulneſs for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits they receive from the Earth, by the Seaſons of the Year, and the influence of Heaven.</p>
               <p>In the ſixth Temple called <hi>Ti vam miao,</hi> or the Temple of the paſt Kings, is a rich Throne, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57084:85"/> the Statues of all the Kings of <hi>China,</hi> from the firſt King, named <hi>To hi to Xum Chi,</hi> Father to the preſent Prince; here the King performs an Annual Ceremony to his Predeceſſors. The ſeventh Temple is called <hi>Chim-Hoam Miao,</hi> or the Temple of the Spirit that guards the Walls; but here the King never Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, but appoints Mandarins, and other Nobles, to do it at his Charge, ſo that the Ceremony is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with much Royalty; and in every City there is ſuch a Temple Dedicated to the ſame end.</p>
               <p>Having proceeded thus far, I ſhall entertain you with an account of his Pomp, and Magnificent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, when he goes out of his palace; and this he rarely does but upon two occaſions, <hi>viz.</hi> either to Hunt, and take the Air, or to Sacrifice, unleſs neceſſity forces him to the Wars; upon theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions he takes a Guard, and all the Nobles that are near have notice, and attend him in their beſt Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page; they moſt conſiſt of between 12 and 13000, adorned with Embroideries of Gold, Silver, and precious Stones, their Horſes traped with the ſame, and all their Servants that attend, at a diſtance, in very rich Attire.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there appear 24 Men with large Drums, in two Files, then the like number of Trumpets in the ſame manner, next as many with long Staves, varniſhed with red, and adorned with gilt Folinges; then 200 Halberdiers, the Heads of their Halberds being like a Creſcent; theſe were followed by 100 Men carrying Maces of gilt Wood, with Staves as long as a Launce; then 2 Royal Poles, called <hi>Caſſi,</hi> varniſhed with Red, and gilded with Flowers at both ends; after theſe 400 large Lanthorns richly adorned, with many curious pieces of Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; theſe were followed by 400 Flambeauxs curiouſly Carved, and made of an odoriferous Wood that burns long, and caſts a curious ſhining light; then 200 Launces fringed and adorned with the Spoiles of Wild Beaſts; theſe are followed by 24 Banners, on which, in Gold, and Rich Imbroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery are repreſented the Signs of the Zodiack, which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57084:86"/> the <hi>Chineſes</hi> divide into 24, contrary to us; after theſe come 56 Banners, with 56 Conſtellations painted on them, under which they comprehend the whole number of Stars; then 2 large Flabels, ſupported with Poles, and gilded with Suns, Birds, Beaſts, and other Things; theſe are ſucceeded by 24 Umbrellos richly adorned; then 8 ſorts of rich Utenſils for the Kings ordinary uſe, as a Table-Cloth, a Baſon and Eure of Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after theſe 10 led Horſes all white, Traped with Imbroidery of Gold and precious Stones, followed by 100 Lanciers, and on both ſides them the Pages of the King that particular belong to his Chamber, and in the middle, between them, the King himſelf, with an Air very Majeſtick and Stern, mounted on a ſtately Steed, covered with a rich Umbrello, coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beyond the belief of ſuch as have not ſeen it, ſhading both the King and his Horſe; he is followed by petty Kings, the Princes of the Blood, and a great number of the Principal Nobility in their richeſt Attire, and ranked according to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; then 500 young Gentlemen belonging to the King, followed by 1000 Footmen clad in red Robes, Embroidered with Stars and Flowers of Gold and Silver; then ſucceeds an open Chair, or Litter, carried by 36 Men, attended by another cloſe Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as big as a handſom Room, carried by 120 Men; then 2 vaſt Chariots, each drawn by 2 Elephants; after theſe another large Chariot drawn by 8 Horſes, and another which is leſs, by 4; theſe have very rich Capariſons lined with Silk, and the Governors in coſtly Liveries, each of them attended by an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer and 50 Soldiers; next to theſe follow 2000 Mandarins of the Learned Tribunal; and to cloſe all, 2000 Military Mandarins, with the King's Train: The People every where receive him with profound Veneration and Reſpect, many Kneeling, and others lifting up their Hands, with Prayers for his Proſperity.</p>
               <p>Beſides the numerous Veſſels in Seaports, on Lakes, and Rivers, many of which have places in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57084:86"/> them like Rooms and Chambers, wherein the People belonging to them live and breed. The number of thoſe that are appointed to carry Proviſions to the Court are near 1000; thoſe that are to attend the Mandarins are very numerous, and the reſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great difficulty are not to be numbered, for all the Lakes, Rivers, and Ports are ſo full of Veſſels, that they ſeem ſo many floating Towns, or Cities, and no leſs than 4 Millions of People are imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Navigation. Their Rivers are many, and exceeding large, ſo that on the River <hi>Kiam,</hi> which is called the Son of the Sea, one may Sail for 3 Months. The Veſſels that are only to bring the King's Habits, Silks, Stuffs, <hi>&amp;c</hi> are 365, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day he has a Change of rich Garments. What ſhall I ſay? The People adore him as a God, and think all the valuable things on Earth too little for him, and therefore it would be endleſs to deſcribe all the Magnificence that attends his State, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing he is ſerved withal. Let it ſuffice then, that no Prince on Earth that ever I ſaw, or heard of, equals him in Grandeur, for his Subjects look on him as the Son of Heaven, and that it is not only their Duty, but a main incumbent of Religion to Honour him in all they can. They bring their Timber, moſtly by the Rivers, not in Veſſels, but in Floats, ſome of 3 Leagues length, faſtened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Ruſhes and Oſiers, and on the Floats are little Wooden Houſes for thoſe that guide them to lodge in by turns, and dreſs their Proviſions: And indeed they bring plenty of all things by their Rivers and Lakes, which ſtores their Cities and Towns very plentifully, which are very numerous, for according to their own Printed Account, of thoſe walled in are 4402, which are divided into two Orders, Civil and Military; the firſt of theſe comprehend 2045, of which 175 are Cities of the firſt Rank, which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> call <hi>Tin;</hi> 274 of the ſecond Rank, which they call <hi>Cheu;</hi> 288 which they call <hi>Hien;</hi> 205 Royal Hoſteries, or places of Entertainment of the firſt, and 103 of the ſecond
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57084:87"/> Rank; and theſe are Govern'd by Mandarins, who, in their Governments are a kind of Viceroys.</p>
               <p>The Nobility of this Kingdom, as generally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is no more than an illuſtrious Grandeur that has continued for ſeveral Ages, but theſe are ſubject to many caſualties, for when the Reigning Family expires, they are generally put to Death, becauſe they are very powerful in the Country, and give a jealous ſuſpition, ſo that new upſtarts are put in their Room, which renders thoſe more ſafe who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this Honour, by the Gown or Military Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, becauſe that Honour is recalled at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the Grand Child ſeldom enjoys that, or their Eſtate. There is but one of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles now remaining that I could here of, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Famous <hi>Confucius,</hi> who was Born under the third Imperial Family, called <hi>Cheu,</hi> 551 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Birth of Chriſt; and this Family has great Priviledges above others, as to be exempted from Taxes and Tribute in the Provinces they Inhabit. They give a Title of Honour of a lower Degree to their learned Men: and Philoſophers are in great Veneration amongſt them, and to ſome of them they have given the Epethite of Saint, and give the ſame Veneration to their Memory as to their Pagods, though they take it as an affront to be taxed with it, for they call them Kings without Command, by which imploy they were worthy of Crowns for their Learning, Virtue; and Wiſdom, but deſteny prevented them. <hi>Confucius,</hi> a Learned Man among the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> who, though long ſince Dead, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and adored amongſt them: He modeled their Law, or Rule, to be obſerved, into nine Maxims, which he called <hi>Chum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yum,</hi> or the Golden Medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, wherein he lays down, that a good Prince ought to have 9 Qualities, or Virtues. 1. To Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern himſelf well that he may ſhow a good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to thoſe he Rules over. 2. To Honour and Cheriſh Learning, and learned Men, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Virtue, frequently to conſult and converſe with the Learned, on the Affairs of the Kingdom.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57084:87"/> 3. To Love and highly reſpect his Kindred, the Princes of the Blood, and to grant them the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Rewards they merit. 4. To be Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Reſpectful to the Nobility in general, and give them their due deſerts. To incorporate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Friendly and Amicable manner with all his Subjects, to equalize his Heart with theirs, and to regard and eſteem them as his own proper ſubſtance and Perſon. 6. To Love his People with a true Affection, unmixed with Diſtimulation; to rejoyce at their Proſperity, and be afflicted at their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. 7. To invite to his Court, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Artiſts, for the quick diſpatch of publick and private buſineſs. 8. To Treat carefully, and with all civility, Embaſſadors ſent from Foreign Princes, that they may ſee in Words and Deeds, the effects of a Princely and Generous Mind. 9. To Cheriſh and Embrace all, that he may engage them to him, to be the Bulwarks and Fortreſſes of his Kingdom. And theſe Rules well practiſed may ſerve other Kings, to render them great and happy.</p>
               <p>The King has a Privy, or Supream Council of the Learned Mandarins in his Pallace, who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Council of State, which is the moſt Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Dignity in the Kingdom; theſe conſult and tranſact all the weighty Affairs, and theſe have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Magnificent Halls in the Pallace, wherein they meet, to conſult according to their Degrees; and when he advances any one to this Dignity, he adds to his Name, the Name of one of theſe Halls. Beſides theſe, there are 11 other Tribunals of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darins, 6 for Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, and 5 for Military Affairs: The firſt of theſe are called <hi>Lo-pu,</hi> and the laſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>-fu,</hi> and theſe are of ancient Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Chineſes</hi> dating it 2000 Years before the Birth of Chriſt; and to theſe Tribunals People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair for the determining their Affairs, and for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; beſides, they diſpoſe of Offices and Truſts, and confirm Honour and Dignities. Their Power is great, for they have a juriſdiction almoſt over all that belongs to the Court, and it is abſolute over all
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57084:88"/> the Provinces, ſo that they are much feared, and dreaded, becauſe they can place and diſplace at pleaſure, and examine into all Frauds and Abuſes to the Crown, and into Eccleſiaſtical matters. They are fearful of doing any injuſtice, by reaſon there is a Mandarin, in the nature of a Controller, or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeer to every Tribunal, who examins publickly or privately all that is done, and if he finds any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice or diſorder, he is bound to make the King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it; he is called <hi>Coli,</hi> ſo that ſeldom any Corruptneſs or Partiality is found amongſt them, and if it be, the Offender is ſeverely puniſhed. There are ſome other dependent Tribunals in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim,</hi> and to every one of the Provinces there belongs a Supream Tribunal, which has the overſight of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Courts, ſo that buſineſs is managed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched with little difficulty.</p>
               <p>They have made prodigeous Works in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to ſecure the Rivers within their bounds, yet notwithſtanding, ſometimes encreaſed by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Rains, they break out to the deſtruction of vaſt numbers of People, Cattle, and Houſes, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the Year 1668, after violent Rains, which almoſt deſtroyed the new City of <hi>Pekim,</hi> and they had much ado to ſecure the Flood from overturning the Walls of the old City, and in this Deluge which was accompanied by an Earthquake, for it had a long time before been a very dry Seaſon, near a Million of People periſhed; and though many got upon Trees, Hills, and Out Houſes, they were there ſtarved for the moſt part, for want of Boats to fetch them off, and the rapid Flood tumbling Rocks along with it, broke down two Arches of the Famous Bridge, which is about a Furlong over: This Bridge is the moſt beautiful in <hi>China,</hi> but not the largeſt; the River overflowing is called <hi>Hoen Ho,</hi> or the Muddy River, becauſe the rapidneſs of its Stream, carries with it a great quantity of Earth, tore from the Banks and Windings, which renders it muddy all the Year, but it is little Navigable, by reaſon of the many Cataracts, or Falls in it; yet
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57084:88"/> for bringing vaſt Stores to <hi>Pekim</hi> from the Southern Provinces, a Canal is opened 3500 <hi>Chineſe</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, through ſeveral Provinces, accommodated with 72 Sluces, every one having large Folding-Gates, and theſe are only open in the day time, ſome of them being very difficult to paſs with Barks of great Burthen, becauſe the Falls are great; but they are drawn up againſt the Stream by the ſtrength of 4 or 500 Men, and let down in the like manner, with many Ropes faſtned to them, to prevent ſetting on the Piles, or plunging, and they are guided by long Poles, with Iron Heads at the end. The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel begins at <hi>Tum Cheu,</hi> about 2 Leagues and an half from <hi>Pekim,</hi> where there is a River, with the Currant of which, Veſſels drive till near the Sea, and then it falls into another, through which Veſſels Sail, till they come to the Chanel; and Sailing a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bout 25 Leagues, a Temple preſents it ſelf, called <hi>Fuen Hui Miao;</hi> or, <hi>The Temple of the Spirit that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the Water;</hi> hither they Row againſt the Stream, but when they come at the Temple they Row with the Stream, for on the Eaſt-ſide, about half a days Journey is a large Lake between high Mountains; this Water ſwells a great River that bent its courſe towards the Sea on the Eaſt, but they ſtopped up the out-let, and with prodigious labour cutting through the Mountain, opened a Canal by which they brought the Water to the Temple; in that part they hollowed 2 other Canals, one towards the South, and another towards the North, with ſo true a proportion and regular Line, that the Waters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the middle before the Temple, take leave of each other, one running to the North, and the other to the South in one and the ſame Canal, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry admirable, and diſcharges it ſelf into a large ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid River, called the <hi>Yellow River,</hi> the Water being ſo coloured by the yellow Earth on the Banks, and Gold coloured Sand and Slime at the bottom; upon this River they Sail 2 Days, and then entering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Paſs to another Canal running towards the City of <hi>Hoaingan,</hi> and running by and through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57084:89"/> Cities, comes to <hi>Yamcheu.</hi> The vaſt Wall of <hi>China</hi> that excludes the <hi>Tartars,</hi> is no leſs to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as a work of Wonder; it runs from Eaſt to Weſt, and in length 405 <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Leagues, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 33 Degrees 10 Minutes, reaching from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Cai yean,</hi> Seated in the extreamity of the Country, called <hi>Leao Tum,</hi> to that of <hi>Canſo,</hi> or <hi>Can cheu,</hi> Seated on the borders of the Province of <hi>Xenſi</hi> in a ſtreight Line, for ſhould the turnings and windings in the Mountains be reckon'd it would make much more; it is guarded by 1327 Towers and Fortreſſes; the Wall is 2 Fathom thick, and 4 in heighth, built moſtly of Stone, though in ſome places Brick appears, where it is ſuppoſed to be mended or altered, ſo that were it vigilently guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and no Treachery, which too often happens by the Captains of the Watches, being bribed with part of the Plunder, the <hi>Tartars</hi> would be too feeble to ſurmount it, for upon this Wall and Frontier only, there are 90254 Men kept in Arms and Pay, and thoſe that keep the Watch-Towers give the Signal of the Enemies approach by a Flag in the day time, and in the Night by Fire.</p>
               <p>Theſe are but part of the King's Forces, for the Auxiliaries that lie ready to march to their aſſiſtance, are in a manner innumerable, for the Horſe only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to 989167, and the Foot are many more, their Pay yearly amounting to 5034714 Livres, though they in ſome ſort maintain themſelves by their Induſtry, and no doubt as great, if not a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number guard on the other Borders, ſo that there are ſeveral Millions in Pay, for in the Kingdom there are 2357 Fortified Places, beſide a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are Garriſoned upon almoſt inacceſſible Mountains and Rocks, that being ſtrong by nature, have no Walls.</p>
               <p>In the 15 Provinces there are 332 Famous Bridges, 2096 Mountains famous for their being cut into the ſhapes of Monſterous Idols, for their Fountains, Minerals, or Fruits, their Waters, ſuch as are Lakes full of Fiſh, hot Fountains wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57084:89"/> Medicinal, large Navigable Rivers and Streams, are 1472.</p>
               <p>There are 1099 pieces of Antiquity to be ſeen, as Statues, Paintings, and curious Veſſels; 1159 Towers and Triumphal Arches erected at Sundry times, to the Memories of thoſe that were renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in War, Learning, or Virtuous Actions; 272 Publick Libraries, ſtored with variety of Books, many of them covered with Gold and Silver Plate, adorned with precious Stones.</p>
               <p>There are yet remaining entire 709 Temples, which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have Erected at ſeveral times to the Memory of their Anceſtors, of curious Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, large and beautiful, and the Names of thoſe to whoſe Memory they were Erected affixed on Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and in theſe the ſeveral Families of the deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aſſemble at a prefixed Day, and proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Ground, in token of Love and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; then they burn Incenſe, and afterwards make a ſplendid Feaſt at ſeveral Tables, richly ſet forth.</p>
               <p>They account 480 Temples of Idols exceeding Rich and Magnificent, beſide many of leſſer Note, attending on theſe are 300000 <hi>Bouzes,</hi> a kind of a Religious Order amongſt them, ſome Married, and others not permitted, beſides a great number that Travel up and down, called <hi>Licentiates,</hi> having their Licenſes to Authorize them from the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>Their Mauſoleums, or Tombs, are very ſtately, to the number of 680, beſides many of leſſer Note; but they Bury their Dead after they have kept them as long as they pleaſe without the Cities, according to the manner of the Eaſtern Countries; their Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins are very Rich, ſo that one of them ſometimes coſts 1000 Crowns. The Catacombs of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees are ſtately Arched Vaults in Mountains, or Plains, over which, when the Body is in, they raiſe a little Mount, planting Fragrant Trees in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on it: Before this they Erect a large Altar of white polliſhed Marble, or Alleblaſter, fixing Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57084:90"/> one upon it, and one on each ſide. They Place Statues, or Figures, in Rows, repreſenting a Hiſtory of the deceaſed's Actions, and are very curious Artiſts in reſembling Paſſions of Grief, Joy, Fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Life. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> reckon 3036 Men Famous for their Virtues and Valour; Two hundred and eight Virgins, and Widows, Renowned for Piety, Chaſtety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe Memories are Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in their Stories, and Poeſies; they are alſo honoured with Titles, Temples, Inſcriptions, and Triumphal Arches.</p>
               <p>There are in this Kingdom 32 Princes, or petty King's Pallaces, reſembling that of the King's, but much leſs. The Cities are Govern'd by Mandarins, as I before hinted; and when any one gets the King's Letter to the Tribunal to be admitted, the Names of the Cities are Written on thin Boards which are caſt into a Veſſel, and on their Knees they draw, and he whoſe Name comes up is allotted the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that City; yet there is jugling in this, for the Tables are ſo, where Money is given, that they ſeldom fail of a rich City, though it is but for a ſet time, <hi>viz.</hi> 3 Years, leaſt they ſhould corrupt Juſtice, or gain on the Affection of the People to raiſe Rebellion; however, they are Reverenc'd like petty Kings, and abundance of Royal Hoſteries are built in Cities, and on the Roads, to entertain them in their Travels, at the King's Charge, where every thing is in a Magnificent readineſs, when they know there is a Mandarin on the Road: There is alſo places for the Entertainment of the Curriers, and to furniſh them with freſh Horſes.</p>
               <p>The Mountains yield Gold and Silver, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Country is ſtored with Treaſure, though Gold indeed is more a Merchandize than a Coin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; the preſents therefore that they make are exceſſive, as 10, 20, or 30000 Crowns at a time. The King eats in Gold Plate, and all his Nobles, and thoſe that are invited, at a vaſt number of Tables in Silver and Porcelain, ſo that the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57084:90"/> at a great Feaſt amounts to 5 or 6 Millions, for there are Cups ſet with Diamonds, and other Stones of vaſt value; ſome are entire Stones, very Rich, and the Noble imitate the Court, as far as their Ability will allow them, they being very Rich, for they uſually get in their 3 Years Government, as Viceroys of Provinces, or Mandarins of Cities, a Million of Crowns; and thoſe that are of the Council of State, called <hi>Calaos;</hi> or, the upper Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, much more by Bribery; for though they proteſt againſt it, and there are ſevere Laws in this Caſe, no Office paſſes the Seal without a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſum of Money underhand.</p>
               <p>There is in this Kingdom vaſt quantities of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Tin, Iron, and other uſeful Metals, of which they make great Guns, Idols, Statues, Diſhes, Cups, and other Things: their Workmanſhip is very fine; of Copper and Tin they make vaſt quantities of Money, with little holes in the middle to ſtring the pieces, and ſo they paſs as ready told, in 500, or 1000 on a String; and 1000 of their Deniers is given for a <hi>Chineſe</hi> Tuel, or Crown. Their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is made in Bank, or places appointed for that end; on one ſide this Money is the Name of the Reigning Prince, and on the other that of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal that cauſed it to be Coined. Their Gold and Silver is not properly to be called a Coin, as being only caſt into Ingots like Boats of different weights and value; ſome of thoſe of Gold are vallued at 20 Crowns, and thoſe of Silver at half a Crown, and ſome more.</p>
               <p>When they bury their Dead they burn a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gilded Ingots, which they call Loans of Gold and Silver, vainly fancying the Aſhes turns to Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the other World, and ſerves their Friends to purchaſe Houſes, Horſes, and Proviſion, likewiſe to bribe the evil Spirits that they ſhould not injure them, and that ſo the good Spirits may be Fee'd, to haſten their Tranſmigration, ſuffering their Souls to enter into Men, and not into Beaſts.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:57084:91"/>
               <p> There is abundance of curious white Silk, and Wax in <hi>China,</hi> and by reaſon of the vaſt Silk Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures made all over the Kingdom, the Ancients ſtiled it the Silken Kingdom, ſo that many Veſſels and Caravans are loaded with it for other Countries. Moſt of the Men, nay, the very Lackeys, and the Women all of them wear Silk, and the richer ſort have it Embroidered with Gold, Silver, Pearl, and other Ornaments.</p>
               <p>The fine Wax peculiar to <hi>China,</hi> is not made by Bees, but a little Fly as big as a Flea lays an Egg that breeds a Worm, which piercing the Wax Trees to the Pith it iſſues out and hangs upon the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches like drops of Dew, and by the Sun and Wind, is hardened and whitened, in ſuch quantities, that it ſerves the Court, the Nobility, and Temples, to make fine tranſparent Tapers.</p>
               <p>Furs are in this Kingdom in vaſt quantities, and almoſt every one wears a finer or coarſer ſort of them, as they are able, for the Linning of their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Seats Chairs, Couches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To mention the ſeveral ſorts of Fruits and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, would be almoſt endleſs, they have all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all we meet with in <hi>Europe,</hi> and a large addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what we have not in variety of Fruit, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of delicious taſt. During 3 Months of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they have vaſt ſtore of Game, and on the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers they pitch Nets 200 Yards long, and ſet dead Wild fowl on their feet, as if they were alive, for ſtakes to decoy the living; as Ducks, Pheſants, Wild Geeſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which, and other Fowl, ſo many are taken, that they are ſold for little or nothing. They have 3 ſorts of Bears which they Hunt, one called the Man bear, the other the Dog bear, and a third the Pig bear, becauſe their Snouts and Faces a little reſemble theſe. Their Paws boiled and well ordered, are a great dainty among the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and the <hi>Tartars</hi> much admire their Fat, which they eat: Theſe are ſcarce, but for Deer, wild Boars, Ellands, Hares, Conies, and the like, they are in vaſt plenty in moſt of the Provinces.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:57084:91"/>
               <p> After all this, the Weather is piercing cold in the Winter Seaſon, and very hot in the Summer; ſo that in the former, they keep Fires in Stoves, and in the latter, retire the better ſort into cool Vaults and Cellers. Their Firing is a kind of a Stone-coal dug in the Mountains, and ſometimes in the Plains, except in Woody Countries, and they are at great charge in Carriage: It gives as violent a heat as Charcoal, and the heat is very laſting. They ſleep on Mats, or Carpets, and in the Day-time ſit together in cluſters on them, the better to preſerve the Heat, for the Colds are ſometimes very Exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; the richer ſort have Beds, and the Stoves are under the floors of their Rooms, which ſometimes by reaſon of the exceſſive Heat take Fire, burning the Houſe, and ſurprizing in the ſuddain Flames, all that are ſleeping in it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chineſes</hi> that they may be Magnified by Strangers, take a pride to be very civil to them, and give them the upperhand at their Feaſts, ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves according to their Degrees; yet the Eldeſt give place to thoſe who come from the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt parts.</p>
               <p>When any Ambaſſador arrives from the <hi>Day,</hi> his Embaſſy is allowed till his departure; he is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all manner of Proviſions, Horſes, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Barks, and lodged in the Royal Palace, where every two days the King ſends him a ſumptuous Entertainment of all ſorts of Varieties. They take great care, and a kind of pride in their Apparel, the poor among them going very Neat and Decent. The learned Men affect a grave Geſture, and count it a ſin to appear in any thing contrary to the Rules of decent Behaviour and Urbanity.</p>
               <p>The Women affect Modeſty, Chaſtity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, keeping themſelves covered, ſo that when they preſent any thing to their neareſt Relations, they lay it down, their Hands being covered with their Sleaves, and retire with Silence: They rarely ſtir abroad, and are exceeding Submiſſive and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient towards their Husbands, there being nothing,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57084:92"/> they command them, though never ſo difficult, but they willingly Enterprize.</p>
               <p>Upon their Feſtival Days, they have a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Illuminations, and Fire-works, repreſenting divers Creatures and Figures in the Air; ſo that on a Hill at a diſtance, one would think all the Cities were on Fire. The Lanthorns in the Pallace, and Royal Halls, are vaſtly Big, <hi>viz.</hi> 20 Cubits, and ſometimes more in Diameter, holding 100 Lamps, or Tapers, ſo that they caſt a glorious Light, and Figers turning in them by the force of the Smoak, repreſent in ſwift motions many curious Actions, as Fights, Dances, Hunting, Hawking and the like.</p>

               <p>HAving viſited <hi>China,</hi> and learned what I thought convenient, for it is not good to be too Inquiſitive, for fear of being taken as a Spy. I began to be weary of the Fatigue, and of ſo long an abſence from my Native Country, wherefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take the firſt opportunity to return home, and it was not long e're Fortune befriended me to paſs by Land; (for the way by the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous, for that little Sea, or rather great Lake, is full of Flats and Shallows, very tempeſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in moſt Seaſons, and has a great number of Rocks
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57084:92"/> in it, with dangerous Eddies, or Whirl-pools, by reaſon about 100 large Rivers diſcharge themſelves violently into it;) for there was a Caravan going from <hi>Pekim</hi> to <hi>Bokara,</hi> and in it I entered my ſelf with all Neceſſaries for my Journey, and in 15 days the Weather being very fair, and our Stages large, we reached <hi>Soezi,</hi> the laſt Town of <hi>China,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the great Wall; and here I ſtored my ſelf with abundance of good Ruburb that grows in their Gardens, which ſtood me in much ſtead when I came into the cold Countries; and from hence we journeyed moſtly <hi>North-weſt,</hi> and the principal Towns in our way, was <hi>Baretola, Kechemire, Kibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Samark,</hi> and ſome others, which by reaſon of my Indiſpoſition on the Road, I ſhall not undertake to deſcribe. Let it ſuffice then, that the <hi>Tartars</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit moſtly this vaſt Track of Land; in ſome places very Mountainous, in others, vaſt Deſerts and Forreſt, the ground Sandy and Stony for the moſt part, and all along I could ſee Snow. On the tops of the high Mountains, though in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Summer, the People are Rude and Simple, moſt of them living by feeding Cattle, which they drive from one place to another, carrying their Wives, Children, and all they have along with them; pitching Tents in their Encampments, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where they find pleaſant Springs, and ſtay there till the Graſs is Eat up, and then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move: The <hi>Tartars</hi> are a very numerous People, and ſpread a vaſt track of Land in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> and Principally they are thus divided, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Precopenſes, Aſialica, Antiqua</hi> and <hi>Cathur</hi> from their Principal Provinces, which may be termed, though there are other numerous little Diviſions too many here to mention; and though they are a cruel kind of People, our Caravan met with no on-ſet by the way, though we ſee numerous Hoards of them on either hand. As we ſee their Houſes are mean and inconſiderable, and their Diet moſtly raw Fleſh in many places, and above all, they are great lovers of the Fat of Bears, yet they give not their Minds
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57084:93"/> ſo much to Robberies as the <hi>Arabs,</hi> or other untra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable Nations, becauſe few of them know the uſe of it, or at leaſt have no great eſteem for Money; ſome are <hi>Idolars,</hi> and ſome <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Track abounds in Furs, and there are ſome Mines of Gold and Silver found in many parts, but they little regard Diging it; and ſo barbarous are they, that many of them dreſs their Children at great Feaſts, to entertain their Gueſs, as the choiceſt of Dainties; nor do they refrain from Feaſtings on their Dead: There are a great many ſtrong Stags and Harts I ſaw in my Paſſage, which they uſe to Ride, carry Burthens, and draw their Waggons, or Sledges. Mulbury-Trees grow in ſome places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Roads, eſpecially bordering on <hi>China,</hi> which are laden in their proper Seaſons with Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms that produce much Silk, but they little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it, it being moſtly gathered by the <hi>Banians,</hi> who live ſcattered among them, who ſend it to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> and other Countries, and have rich Merchandize in return; for here the coldneſs of the Country obliges them moſtly to habit themſelves in Furs, and thick courſe Cloathings. They trade much in White and Black Fox Sables, Hart and Fawn Skins; they have vaſt Forreſts of Black Wood, wherein many huge Bears lurk to ſurprize Travellers, which made us keep cloſe together when we paſſed ſuch places, and have our Eyes about us, as well as our Fire-arms in readineſs; and ſo keeping the Road, though not without many turnings, and ruged ways, when we had paſſed <hi>Samark,</hi> and it brought us to <hi>Bockar,</hi> where I ſtaid ſome time to refreſh me, for I had been ill of a Flux by the way, which ſtill held me ſo, that I took no great pleaſure to make any cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious remarks here, and had I done it, as I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, there is nothing worthy of Note in the Town, the Houſes being plain and low Built, the Streets crooked, and no Antiquities memorable. Here the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> and <hi>Yousbecs Tartar</hi> are driving a conſiderable Trade together in Furs, and other Commodities.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:57084:93"/>
               <p> Having here pretty well recovered, by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a <hi>German</hi> Phyſician, I found in this place, I thought, a convenient opportunity to paſs to <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan,</hi> which in a few days, I had, paſſing part of the way in Sledges, drawn by Harts, that run with them very ſwiftly; and an other part, by taking Horſe, there being a kind of a little Caravan, made up by the meeting of divers Travellers. The <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> uſe Sledges, that in the Winter they ſlide ſwiftly over the Snow and Frozen Rivers, having Beds in them, and covered over with Tilts like Waggons, ſo that they are a warm Convenience; notwithſtanding in Winter, Travellers have been Frozen to Death in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtrakan</hi> is Seated on the Great and Famous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Volga,</hi> which at 70 Mouths, or Channels, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges its Water into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, and ſo forcibly, that it keeps it ſtream unmixed with the Salt-water for many Leagues. In this River, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have a great Fiſhery for Sturgeon, which they catch in abundance very large, ſo that the Eggs ſometimes found in one of them, may weigh 100 Weight: As for the Fleſh, they pickle up and ſend it into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſome they preſs to make Oyl, and the Eggs they ſalt to make Ragous to ſerve them inſtead of Butter, which in <hi>Lent</hi> is denied them, and this is the Cavere ſo much uſed in many Countries. In the Summer, there are ſo many <hi>Muskela's,</hi> or <hi>Sting Gnats,</hi> about this River, that Paſſengers are miſerably Stung and Bliſtered by them, though they wrap themſelves up, and defend them all they can.</p>
               <p>We were forced to ſtay before this City, till we obtained leave of the Governor for admittance; which after a little attendance, was granted: It is Seated in 48 Degrees <hi>North</hi> Latitude, in an Iſland of the <hi>Volga,</hi> 13 Leagues from the Mouth of the River, and appartains to the Great <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> It is encompaſſed with a double Wall, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fortification, except ſome few Towers, half Musket Shot one from an other. The Great Guns
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57084:94"/> planted there are fine pieces, and about 80 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it ſtands low on gravelly Ground, ſo that the heat is exceſſive in Summer, and the People are conſtrained to Bath themſelves in cool Water in Troffs placed in Vaults; yet the Soil produces good Fruit of ſundry kinds, they have ſtore of excellent Mellions, eſpecially the Karpous, or Water Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, their Rhinds Green, but of a Roſey Red with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, of a pleaſant taſt, cooling and delicate to quench Thirſt. There are divers ſorts of Grapes, of which they make a kind of pleaſant Wine, but it ſoon Sowers: All this while, no private Perſon dares touch a Grape till the Governour has made choice of them, and other Fruits, for the <hi>Czar's</hi> Table. There are divers Nations inhabiting here, drawn by the Convenieney of Trade, and the ſweetneſs of the Air. The <hi>Armenians</hi> entirely poſſeſs one Suburb, and the <hi>Nogais Tartars</hi> an other, which reſemble a City, being Fortified with Wooden Ramports, and the Deputy Governour Commands there; within the Encloſure ſtands a pretty convenient Moſque, but the Houſes for the moſt part are made of Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes, of which there are about 2000. They keep a Market in the Morning in their Quarter, and the <hi>Maſcovites</hi> keep theirs in the Evening, in the middle of their City; yet this City is often inſulted by the <hi>Calmuc Tartars,</hi> which conſtrains the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants for their better Repoſe, to ſend them Preſents, which the <hi>Tartars</hi> call a Tribute of Bread, Fiſh, Fleſh, and other Proviſions, and they drive a Trade with them for Furs and Horſes, of which they bring great plenty; beſides the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are many times obliged to them, for their aſſiſting them with Men in the time of their Wars.</p>

XX. <hi>Travels in</hi> Muſcovy, <hi>and Obſervations of what is worthy of Note; as to the Towns, Rivers, Mountains, Commodities, Heats and Colds, Laws, Religion, Manners and Cuſtoms of the People,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and from thence through</hi> Poland <hi>and</hi> Germany <hi>into</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</head>
               <p>HAving a deſire to ſee <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and particularly <hi>Moſcow,</hi> the chief City, I made it my buſineſs to find an opportunity to leave <hi>Aſtrakan,</hi> and paſs thither.</p>
               <p>As for this vaſt Country, it is bounded on the <hi>Weſt</hi> with <hi>Lithuania</hi> and <hi>Livonia;</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> with <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary;</hi> on the <hi>North,</hi> with the Frozen Ocean; on the <hi>South,</hi> with the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and <hi>Paulus Maeotis.</hi> It is branched with many large Navigable Rivers, as the <hi>Tanais, Borhiſtenes, Volga,</hi> &amp;c. It is divided into 9 Provinces, <hi>viz. Novog, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, Valademira, Pleſcovia, Rheſen, Servia, Parmia, Condoria, Petroſa</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> though from this laſt, the whole Track takes its Denomination.</p>
               <p>Towards the <hi>Southern</hi> parts, it is pretty plentiful of many things of Value, yielding Corn, Cattle, Furs, Flax, Hemp, Wax, Honey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the <hi>Northern</hi> parts lye very cold, the Earth being ſo long covered with Snow, that the Ground is chilled, and produces not its Fruits kindly; yet Furs are gotten off of White, Black and Red Foxes, Grey and Red Squrrils, Minever Ermins, Wolverin, or wild Dogs. The Woods which are generally Fur
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57084:95"/> and Birch, abound in Ravenous Creatures, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, Wolves and Bears, which in the extremity of Weather, pinched by Cold and Hunger, comes in great Cluſters to the Villages near the Forreſt, and puts the Inhabitants to flight many times, kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and devouring them and their Cattle, ſo that at ſuch times, by way of prevention, they are forced to be on their Guard. But as to theſe, and other matters of the like nature, I ſhall take them in courſe, as my Travels lay in this Country, which is of vaſt extent from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> if you meaſure from <hi>Cola</hi> to <hi>Aſtrakan,</hi> which bendeth ſomewhat <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> which is reckoned the length of it is accounted 4260 verſt or ruff Miles, though one of them makes not above 3 quarters of our Miles though <hi>Northward.</hi> Beyond <hi>Cola,</hi> there is a large Country unto the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Tromſchua,</hi> that runeth 1000 verſt Miles, but the ridged Winter Froſt renders it not much inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and little fruitful in Summer. As for the Breadth, if one goes from that part of the Czar's Teritories, that lies fartheſt <hi>Weſt,</hi> on the <hi>Narve</hi> ſide, to the utmoſt parts of <hi>Siberia</hi> Eaſtward, where are divers Gariſons, it is 4200 verſt Miles: But to come near as a Traveller, conſidering how to get the ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and eaſieſt way to <hi>Moſcow,</hi> it being in <hi>June,</hi> when the Rivers were open, I was perſwaded to Embark on the <hi>Volga,</hi> which I did with a Merchant of that City, who ſhewed me a great deal of kindneſs, the Veſſel being his own; for from <hi>Aſtrakan</hi> to <hi>Moſcow,</hi> it is accounted 18000 verſt Miles. We ſailed till we came to the Mouth of the River <hi>Cama,</hi> which diſchargeth its Waters into the River <hi>Volga,</hi> and ſo made our way by Water and Land to <hi>Cazan,</hi> which the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> a few Ages ſince took from the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> and is the Metropolis of a Kingdom. It is a City of conſiderable Tade, it was formerly walled with Timber and Earth, but upon annexing the whole Kingdom to the Crown of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> the great Czar <hi>Vaſiliwich</hi> walled it with Free-ſtone. The Building is not Stately, yet very Commodious, for the Inhabitants, who are a mixed People, as they are
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57084:95"/> on all the Borders; we lodged and refreſhed our ſelves here, and paſſed in a 11 days through a fine Country, well Watered, and very Fruitful, to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable fair Town, which we reached in 10 days, called <hi>Niſnovogrod,</hi> where <hi>Occa</hi> falls into the <hi>Volga.</hi> This is the head of a Shire, or County of that Name, and from hence by <hi>Rezan,</hi> and ſo paſſing a tedious Journey through many difficult ways, we came to the River <hi>Moſcow,</hi> on whoſe Banks the City of <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow</hi> ſtands. I ſhould have told you I left my Merchant Trading up the River <hi>Camaon,</hi> on whoſe Banks are ſeveral and pretty Towns, but he took care to provide me a Guide, who accompanied me to <hi>Moſcow,</hi> the neareſt way over the Land, and to help me to Imbark where the Rivers offered to leſſen our Journey, for I did not think fit to fall directly down the <hi>Volga</hi> into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, which would little have furthered me.</p>
               <p>Being arrived at the head City of <hi>Moſcow,</hi> I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on the River ſide, and finding ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, I was not long deſtitute of a Habitation, and being Evening when I entered, I thought fit to reſt that Night, and the next day went to take a view of the City, which is very large. The Form of it is in a manner round, with three ſtrong Walls, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling the one within the other, the Streets lying pretty commodiouſly within all the Heart or Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incloſed by the inmoſt Wall, is called the <hi>Czar</hi>'s Caſtle, or Pallace, very large in Circle; the Houſes of ordinary Perſons are but indifferently built with Timber, Loam and Mortar, covered with Boards or Bark of Trees; but the Houſes of the Nobles are pretty Sately. The Churches are many, and they are Adorned on the tops with Globes of Copper, and guilded Spires. That of <hi>Blaneſhina</hi> or <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> is of curious Architecture, after the Faſhion of the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, whoſe Tenents in Religion, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> devoutly hold; the Church of St. <hi>Michael</hi> is nothing inferiour to it, but above all, the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral called, <hi>Our Ladies Church,</hi> is large and ſtately; in it the Czars are Crowned by the Patriarch. The
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57084:96"/> Market is kept in the Caſtle, or within the inward Wall, unleſs the River be Frozen over, and then it is partly kept thereon, and ſometimes alltogether; ſo that upon the Ice bareing all ſorts of Carriages, there appears to be a kind of a Fair, becauſe the People bring vaſt quantities of Goods from remote places on their Heads. The Caſtle is on a riſing Hill, well Watered and Fortified, and the Princes's Palace very conveniently contrived, but his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon publick Occaſions, as at the Audience of Ambaſſadors, and the like, is more Magnificent, they being in great Numbers moſtly Arrayed in Cloath of Gold and Silver, rich Furs, Velvets, Pearls and pretious Stones; Battle Axes of Gold are carried before the Czar, and his Robes exceeding rich of Goldſmiths Work, poudered with pretious Stones and Imbroderies of Pearl; their Feaſts are ſerved up in Diſhes of Gold, the meaneſt Veſſel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Silver, and both kinds very numerous. The Diet is choice, and well dreſſed, according to the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Faſhion; their Drink is Wine, Meath, and ſometimes ſtrong <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> which among them is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alled <hi>Ruſs</hi> Wine.</p>
               <p>In this City are ſtill to be ſeen ſome Ruins of the Walls the ſeveral Fires have made, for I was told it contained 41500 Houſes before the <hi>Crim Tartars</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it to Aſhes, <hi>Anno</hi> 1571. and in it deſtroyed 80000 People, and beſides the Houſes, 1500 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Churches and Chapples. The <hi>Poles</hi> burnt it <hi>Anno</hi> 1611. and <hi>Anno</hi> 1676. an Accidential Fire happened Burning 20 days, but now Guards are appointed, to take care of Fire, and have Sallaries allowed them. There is one thing Admirable, which is a Bell raiſed in a large Tower; this Bell is 24 foot in height, and I was told, though it has been chipped off ſome Tuns of Mettle to make it ring better, that it weighs 176 Tun, and the Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per 4 Tun, which is pulled by a Rope to ſound it on particular occaſions, for it cannot be raiſed by reaſon of its vaſt weight.</p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:57084:96"/>
               <p> Proviſions are very plentiful here, as Fiſh, Fowl, Veniſon, Hares, and other Dainties; for the Woods, Rivers, and Lakes, which are very many and large, abound with theſe, and divers other uſeful Creatures, and in ſome parts of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> they draw their Sledges with Rain-deer, who do the Office of Horſes, and run more ſwiftly. In my paſſing <hi>Tartary,</hi> I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the like; they alſo uſed there great Dogs for the ſame purpoſe, and on the Borders, I met ſeveral riding on Elks.</p>
               <p>I ſaw in this City many Bath-ſtones, and other Stones, which in the Winter are uſed in all places, which prevents their being pinched by the ridged Froſts, which are extream from <hi>October</hi> till <hi>March,</hi> accompanied with vaſt Snows, ſo that in that Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, there is little ſtiring abroad; for the Air is ſo piercing, that many have been ſtifled with it going out of their Houſes, eſpecially too early; and they report in that Seaſon, it is frequent to find People frozen to Death in the Streets, and many are brought in Dead in Sledges frozen, though they have Beds there to lye on, and Tilt Coverings of Furskins o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; and for this time all the Rivers and Lakes are locked up, the Ice uſually a Yard thick or more, yet they have ſtore of Grain, as Wheat, Rye, Oats, Maize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Plums, Pears, Cherries, black and red, Hurtle Berries, Apples, Raſps, Strawberries, and other delicate Fruits; for ſo the Almighty Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom has ordained it, that when the time of Thaw comes, which is uſually the end of <hi>March,</hi> the Snow being cleared off the Ground, after that becoming dry in 14 days, Flowers, and all other products of the Earth ſprout out and flouriſh incredibly; the Woods ſhow a pleaſing Green, and the Birds every where warble Mellodiouſly, eſpecially Nightingals, who Sing more diſtinct and clear than any where elſe. The Storks buſy themſelves in Building in ruined Edifices, Hawks of all kinds in the Rocks and Sea-ſhoar-cliffs, Eagles in the rockey Mountains more <hi>Northernly;</hi> the Hare in Winter is White, ſheds her Coat, and becomes the colour of ours.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57084:97"/> The Lakes and Rivers are ſtocked with Swans, and variety of other Water Fowl, ſo that the face of things ſeem admirably changed, and the Country is ſo pleaſant, that thoſe who ſhould ſee it in Winter how Diſmal, and in a manner Deſolate it appears, (and knows no more) would conclude it impoſſible, or take it for quite an other Climate. Therefore I took my opportunity of Travelling here, whilſt it was ſeaſonable, for the dreadful Stories I heard of Winter, made me ſometimes allmoſt fancy I had an Ague in my Bones at the Relation of them; but the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are hardy, anſwerable in a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the Climate, and are more patient of Cold and Hunger than others, by which means they have the advantage of their Enemies, in firing them out by Winter Camps, and other Fateigues: For a <hi>Ruſs</hi> Soldier told me, he had often made his Bed in the Snow without any Tent, only hanging up his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle againſt that part, from whence the Weather drove, and turning his back to the Wind, his Drink being the cold Stream, with a little Oat-meal duſted into it; and the Forage for his Horſe, conſiſted in that Seaſon, of Twigs and Bark of Trees, and yet performed well the ſervice undertaken; others to harden and inure themſelves to the Cold the better, go abroad Hunting the Beaſts that bare the Furs, have come ſweating out of their Bath Stoves in the ridged Seaſon, and leaped Naked into a River, where the Ice has been broken; and it is a remedy among them againſt the Numbneſs of their Limbs, occaſioned by cutting Winds, to rowl themſelves in Snow; yet for all this, there are many tender a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that cannot endure theſe hardſhips.</p>
               <p>The Women are much confined at Home, and very Obliging and Obedient to their Husbands, yet ſo much Heat as they endure, being cloſed up in Winter, tending their Fires, makes them but of a bad Complexion, yet they mend their Faces by their Husbands allowance, with a Red and White Paint, but eaſily diſcernable; yet being the Faſhion, is not minded, and eſpecially, among the Vulgar: If
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57084:97"/> a Man ſometimes beats not his Wife, ſhe will be Sullen, and fancy he loves her not, and they have a Cuſtom, when they firſt pretend Courtſhip, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Preſents, to ſend a Whip to ſhow the Woman what ſhe has to truſt to, if ſhe prove Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and this they take more kindly than the reſt; but I find theſe matters, though proper to be known, yet ſome digreſſion from Travels, have drawn me to launch too far this way, therefore now I come ſomething more home to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The next chief City of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> is <hi>Novogrod,</hi> pleaſantly Seated, and a place of conſiderable Trade; the Building moſtly of Wood, as generally the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is in all this Country, the Streets in many places not paved, but planked with Furr, jointed and laid in ſo, that it ſhoots the Water off commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; it is the head of a Province or Shire, where the Court of Juſtice do determine matters, is held by a Duke and Dyack, the Latter acting in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Secretary; and theſe Courts are held in all chief Cities, but an Appeal lays from them to the Office of the four Chetfrids at <hi>Moſcow,</hi> who are chief Judges of the four Quarters, or Diviſions of the whole Country of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> each holding an Office for his Diſtrict or Quarter, and all the Shires or Provinces apply themſelves to the Office of that Lord of the Chetfrid they are under, then the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is laid before the <hi>Czar</hi>'s Council, and what they Determine, is ſent back to be put in Execution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vologda</hi> is an other principal City, ſeated on a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of that Name, where is a great Trade for Furs, Hides, Tallow, Corn and other Merchandize, bringing in a conſiderable Revenue in Cuſtoms and other Taxes to the Prince, who has a part in this an other places, for almoſt every thing that is ſold, ſo that his Incoms are very great, accounted no leſs than 13 Millions of Rubbles a Year, and a Rubble is reckoned according to Exchange, a Mark <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voldomir</hi> is an other City of conſiderable Trade, and gives name to a Province; it is built very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57084:98"/> and pretty well Fortified, and is watered by a conſiderable Stream, at leaſtways very near it: But beſides <hi>Moſcow,</hi> the Towns or Cities of chief ſtrength, are <hi>Vobsko</hi> and <hi>Smolensko, Cazan</hi> and <hi>Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan</hi> lying on the Borders, and defending the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try againſt the Inroads or Incurſions of the <hi>Tartars. Jaruſlave,</hi> an other fair City for its commodious Scituation on a high Bank of the <hi>Volga,</hi> is in great Eſteem: The Country about it is exceeding Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Corn-paſture, Fruit-trees, and has a great Fiſhery on the River. In this City, they ſay, dwelt the <hi>Ruſs</hi> Prince <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lademia,</hi> Sir-named, <hi>Jaruſlave,</hi> who at the Mediation of <hi>Sneno,</hi> the Dane, married the Daughter of our King <hi>Harold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Periſlave</hi> is a conſiderable City, commodiouſly built on the Banks of a great Lake, yielding in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Fiſh, and enriching it by Trade from ſuch Towns as border on that Lake, or the Rivers that fall into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſtove</hi> may be numbered among the reſt; for here is a great Trade for Furs, and other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, bought up to diſperſe into other parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and Merchants come hither as far as <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſome ſay from <hi>China,</hi> beyond the great Wall built to exclude the roving <hi>Tartars,</hi> of which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoke of. There are a great number of other Towns, the Country being moſtly to the <hi>Southern</hi> parts full of them, but not ſo conſiderable as theſe I have named; for the Houſes are of Wood, moſt without any Lime or Stone, built very cloſe and warm, with Fur-trees plained and piled over one another, faſtned together with Notches or Dents at every Corner; and between the Timber for warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they ſtuff in Moſs, and the Houſes have Stairs leading out of the Yard into the Chamber, and this manner of Building ſeems more agreeable to the Country than any other, as being far warmer than Stone or Brick in the extremity of Winter, and in Summer, the Moſs being pulled out of the Chinks, lets in the cool breathing Air to refreſh them; and of this Timber, they have ſuch plenty, that for a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57084:98"/> ſmall matter a Houſe may be Built with many Ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pendages, or Conveniences for Shops, Merchants, Ware-houſes, or private Families, for 20 or 30 Rubbles, or little more; and when the Houſes fall to decay, they ſtore them conſiderably with Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and other Neceſſaries, as <hi>Perma, Weclinda, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, Kentiſma, Solovetsky, Ocona, Bombaſey,</hi> and <hi>None-nosks,</hi> are famous for their Salt-pits, where great quantities are made, and out of which the <hi>Czar</hi> has a conſiderable Revenue, as 3 <hi>Ruſs</hi> on every hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Weight.</p>
               <p>The Rivers that water this Country, beſides what I have named, are <hi>Wichida,</hi> a long and large River which riſes out of the Country of <hi>Permia,</hi> and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the <hi>Volga. Duna,</hi> that empties it ſelf into the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, by the Town of <hi>Riga. Onega,</hi> that falleth into the Bay of <hi>Solovetsko,</hi> ninety Verſt from St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi> This River below the Town of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Polia,</hi> meeteth with <hi>Volock,</hi> that falls into the <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Sea, by the Town of <hi>Yama,</hi> ſo that from the Port of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> into the <hi>Finland</hi> Sea, one may go by Water to <hi>Suchana.</hi> This River floweth into <hi>Duyna,</hi> and ſo into the <hi>North</hi> Sea; there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Fiſh in it, and in the open Seaſon it is in a manner covered with Water-fowl. <hi>Duyna</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred Miles long, which falleth <hi>Northward</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bay of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> a Bay ſo Named by one <hi>Chancelour,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, who firſt found a <hi>North-Eaſt</hi> paſſage to <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> in 1553. and called the Bay St. <hi>Nichola</hi>'s Bay, from an Abby Dedicated to that Saint ſtanding near it; and upon notice of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, was ſent for with great Joy by the Czar to <hi>Moſcow,</hi> whether he went on Sledges 1500 Miles, and was received in great Joy, and highly Feaſted with great State and Magnificence, the Court ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in all its Splendor overjoyed now in hopes of an open Trade by Sea, for before they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to carry their Merchandize through the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill</hi> Territories of <hi>Poland, Sweeden,</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to ſhip them for theſe parts; and hereupon Ambaſſadors were ſent to <hi>England,</hi> and a free Trade
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57084:99"/> granted with large Priviledges, whereupon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany now called the <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Company, ſettled Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories at <hi>Arch-Angel,</hi> and other Towns adjacent, having Lands allowed them, and an Agent, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul permitted to reſide at <hi>Moſcow,</hi> though ſince the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and other Nations, have found the way, and interloped upon them: This Bay lies in 64 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <hi>North</hi> Latitude, yet the Country about it is very pleaſant in the open Seaſon, and in the River ſtands an Iſland called <hi>Roſe</hi> Iſland, where are Roſes Damask, Red Violets, and abundance of pleaſant Flowers and Fruits. There is a Monaſtery near it of 700 Monks, who live after the Greek manner, and have large In-coms, for they receive rent for the Lands lying many Miles round them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, there is in this Country many deſarts and waſt places, eſpecially to the <hi>Northward,</hi> with rockey Shoars and craggy Mountains; but on the latter, they breed Goats, and a kind of wild Horſe, Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verins, or wild Dogs, but the latter moſtly in the Woods near the Rocks, they find a Fiſh called <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> a Sea Monſter, who by the help of his Teeth, clambers up to get his prey of Eggs that the Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowl lay in the Pits, and hollow places; his Teeth are about two foot long and better for uſe than Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of which they make Knives and Sword halfs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They fancy that in purſuing theſe on the Ice, and the Flakes breaking away, ſome of their People were driven by the Currants and Winds on the coaſt of <hi>America,</hi> and ſtocked in a great length of time that large fourth part of the World, becauſe there is ſome reſemblance between them, but I fancy this opinion Groundleſs. They Hunt likewiſe the Seals on the Ice, and kill them by ſtriking them on their Noſes with Clubs, and make good Merchandize of their Skins, and the Oyl they get from them.</p>

               <p>The Parliament is held at <hi>Moſcow,</hi> compoſed of the Clergy and Nobility, ſummoned by the Czar, who ſits in his Throne in that Aſſembly, and others according to their Degree. Then the Dyack, or Secretary, reads what is purpoſed by the Prince to be propounded to them; the Patriarch, with his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and other Clergy, are hereupon required to give their Opinions firſt in order, who generally conſent to what is propounded, and the Nobles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with them, as thinking ſuch Holy Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Err; then is it drawn up and ſent to be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſtanding Law in the principle Cities and head Towns of the Empire. The <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> as to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are Chriſtians of the Greek Church, very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious in their Worſhip; for they often in their Devotion beat their Fore-heads againſt the floors of their Churches, till they are Swelled, and ſometimes Bloody; they pay a Veneration to Saints, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, to St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> whom they ſtile their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, they Reverence the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and others. They have the Croſs and Holy Water in high eſteem among them, and their Biſhops go in Proceſſion to hollow the Rivers once a Year, at which time the People ſtrive for the Water; many leap into it, and dip their Infants, though the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be extream cold: This Water ſo Hollowed, is likewiſe given to the Sick, with a fancy it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them, or by cleanſing, make them fit for an other World. They keep four <hi>Lents,</hi> and then they abſtain from ſtrongs Liquors, and all groſs ſort

               <p>Their Marriages are celebrated as ours, but with ſome odd different Ceremonies, <hi>viz.</hi> The Bride ſtoops down and knocks her Head againſt the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms Shew, in token of her Submiſſion and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and the Friends of the Bride bow to him; then they break Bread and Eat it among them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that by this Marriage, the Friends on either ſide are united as the crumbs of Bread were in the Loaf, and that they are to account themſelves as one Man, and one Family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Funerals of their Dead are very ſolemnly performed; they Waſh and Apparel the Body very neatly, then are their Mourners appointed for ſome days to Howl over it, and often to demand what was the occcaſion it died, ſeeing it wanted nothing of Wordly Goods, as Meat, Drink, Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> naming the ſorts and kinds, and then ſet up a hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lamentation, much like the wild <hi>Iriſh:</hi> If it be in the open Weather, it is put into a Grave in a few days, but in the hard Weather, when the Ground cannot be dug, they pile the Bodies up in a Houſe, they call God's Houſe, and when the Seaſon is practicable, every one fetches away his Dead, and buries it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are generally very Corpulent, and of a large ſize, ſtrong, and of late grown Dexterous in the feats of Arms, particularly Fire-arms; they have abundance of great Ordinance, ſome carrying Bullets two foot Diameter.

If in a Law controverſie the Judge cannot decide it, he demands if they will kiſs the Croſs on their Affirmation, or denial; if the Defendant does it, he is acquitted of his Debt, or Injury done; if both require it, then they draw Lots, and he that has the better Lot, is only allowed it, and concluded to be in the right. But in Criminal matters they uſe Tortures, and thoſe very ſevere ones, to extort confeſſions, but if the party hold out againſt them he is acquitted. They have one ſort of Execution very odd, which is, by putting Criminals under the Ice to be ſmothered in the Waters, but cannot be done at all times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have many more, as Hanging, and the like.</p>

               <p> Theſe are the Principal matters I obſerved, or was Informed of in this Country, worthy to be placed in a Hiſtory of this Nature; and now fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Winter locked after my having been in ſo many warm Regions, I bethought me of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving nearer home, becauſe the cold Seaſon was approaching, wherein I was very ſenſible, it would be very Incommodious for a Stranger to travel in theſe parts, and therefore I took an opportunity of a Caravan going for <hi>Poland,</hi> part of which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try I paſſed, but had little or no time to take a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of it, only thus much I ſhall ſay in General. The <hi>Borhiſtenes</hi> bounds it from the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire on the Eaſt, on the Weſt it has the <hi>Viſtual,</hi> on the North the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea and <hi>Sinus Trinitus,</hi> on the South <hi>Hungary;</hi> and is divided into 10 Provinces, viz. <hi>Luconia, Lithunia, Vollina, Samogita, Pedelia, Ruſſia, Nigra, Podlaſia, Moſovia</hi> and <hi>Poland;</hi> and the Latter giving the Country its generally accepted Name. Theſe Provinces are Branched with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Navigable Rivers, as <hi>Viſtua, Raben, Bog, Mimel;</hi> its Metropolis is <hi>Cracow,</hi> or <hi>Craconia,</hi> where uſually the King has his Reſidence.

Cracow</hi> is Scituate on the Banks of the River <hi>Viſtua,</hi> Navigable 400 Miles, being as it were Encompaſſed with diſtant mountains, and fortified with ſtrong Walls; the Buildings are very fair. This Country produces Tar, Roſin, Pitch, Wax, Honey, Barly, Oats, Amber, Tallow, Hides, Minerals, and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; and therein by Trading are found the Commodities of divers other Nations: we ſtayed not here, but paſſing ſome other Province Entred <hi>Germany,</hi> by the Way of <hi>Hungary, Auſtria,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Thoſe called Imperial Cities, by reaſon of their great Privileges above the reſt, in Coining Money, bargaining, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of Subjection, unleſs to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, whom they acknowledge their Protector, and pay him Annual Tribute ſo.

               <p>This large Country produces Silver Mines, Copper, Lead, Tin, Iron, Corn, Wine, Allum, Quick Silver, Linnen, Woollen, Linnen-Stuffs, Silks, ſtore of Cattle, and many other Commodities? and from hence by Land and Water I reached the Low Countries, and briefly, I ſo directed my way, that I cam to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the chief trading City in the Province of <hi>Holland.</hi> It is ſeated on the River <hi>Tay,</hi> which on the North ſide of it, flows like a large Sea; when on the South the River <hi>Amſter</hi> running through 3 Lakes, entereth its Streets, and falleth into the River <hi>Tay;</hi> and by the Addition of a new City to the old, it is become very Commodious, and Strongly fortified; and in it are to be found the Commodities of almoſt all Nations, tho' the Country produces nothing very conſiderable of its own, but theſe things come by Navigation, for moſt of the Inhabitants are Merchants, who's Goods are brought by Veſſels to their Doors, and Warehouſes; and the People are generally Frugal, Induſtruous and Rich.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57084:102"/> was more terrible, and threatned more danger than any I had ſeen before, which made me repent my attempting ſo raſhly, as thinking God was angry with me for my preſumption, and then concluded if I could get ſafe aſhoar I would reſt quiet, with what I had ſeen and felt; the Storm at laſt blew over, and then a freſh gale, Providence ſo ordered it, that we reached the deſired Port.</p>
               <p>Being now on Land again at <hi>Cales,</hi> or <hi>Cadiz,</hi> in the Dominion of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſuch is man's frailty, I found my deſire of Travelling not ſo much quenched, as in the Tempeſt I fancied it. A ſecret Inclination promiſed, and urged me on, that ſeeing I had made ſo many weary ſteps in 3 parts of the World, I ſhould now venture upon the propoſed fourth, held to be Larger and Richer than any of the other three, and as fortune would throw it in my way, to make me more reſolved on it, a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Merchant whom I had been Intimately Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withal in <hi>London,</hi> I renewed my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, and he Entertained me very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy, but when I opened my Mind, and unboſomed my Intentions, he told me it would be a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult undertaking, becauſe the Officers of the Port had very ſtrict Orders not to permit Strangers to Embarque for the <hi>Spaniſh Indies,</hi> leaſt they might be ſent thither as Spies to diſcover the Havens, and Strength of the Forts, and other things that might be prejudicial to the Government. I told him I had no ſuch Intention, that curioſity was only to inform my ſelf, as a Travellor, of what was rare to be obſerved in a World, which the alwiſe God had ſo Admirally framed and ordered, and when I gave him a general account in what Parts I had been, and ſhowed him my Papers of Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums, and curious Remarks, he was ſatisfied, promiſed to do his Endeavour for the furtherance and ſecurity of my paſſage, and to furniſh me with Money ſutable to the Country, upon Bills I gave him to receive by Exchange in <hi>London;</hi> and then he let me know he was a Part-owner in one of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57084:103"/> Ships, that was to accompany the Galeons, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the St. <hi>Johns D' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lua;</hi> and to be brief, when the Fleet was ready to Sail, he gave the Maſter private orders to conceal me in his Cabin, and uſe me as a puculiar friend of his. I had pretty well learned the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which with little more attention I doubled, not to Improve ſo well in my Voyage as to be taken for a <hi>Spaniard</hi> among the Native <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> who, I was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but corruptly ſpoke the Language of old <hi>Spain.</hi> In a little time a warning Piece was fired for the Fleet to weigh Anchor, and tho' our Ship was narrowly ſearched, I ſo well wraped my ſelf up in a Ticking, and lay inſtead of a Bolſter at the Bedſhead, that I was not diſcovered, tho' they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up the Quilt, and other covering to ſee if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had abſconded under them, that were not Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed to depart.</p>
               <p>Anchors weighed, and the Wind being fair, we ſet Sail with a proſperous Gale till we came to <hi>Colfo d' Yeguas,</hi> a very turbulent Sea, where the Ships and Galeons rowled and tottered extreamly, the Waves daſhing violently, by reaſon of an Eddy oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by a current that ſet into it, and the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon who went only a Convoy, having convey'd us thus, left us as concluding we were out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; eſpecially of the <hi>Barbary</hi> Coriſaries, and then by the Maſters advice I ſhowed my ſelf on the Decks, as not fearing to be carried back again, or hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my further paſſage; and having the Wind conſtantly favourable, we ſteered our courſe without meeting with any thing Remarkable, till we made the Land of <hi>America,</hi> about 6 Weeks after we ſet out from <hi>Cales.</hi> Here I ſaw many Dorados, or Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fiſh, ſporting in the Water, ſo called, becauſe their Skins are of the Colour of Gold, and the Sailers with Hooks and Lines catched a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them: they Eat ſomething like a Herring, but more ſhort and Sweet. The firſt Land we ſtood in with, was <hi>Deſſeada,</hi> or as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have named it, <hi>The deſired Land,</hi> as being firſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57084:103"/> found by <hi>Collumbus,</hi> when he diſcovered the Weſtern <hi>Indies,</hi> but paſſing by it we ſtood with another Iſland, called <hi>Margalanted;</hi> Paſſing by that and <hi>Dominica,</hi> we arrived at <hi>Guadalupe,</hi> where we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſigned to Refreſh ourſelves, and caſting An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in a ſafe Road before the Iſland, as many as would, had leave to go on aſhoar. The <hi>Indians</hi> who Inhabit it, no ſooner ſaw our Ships which they had long waited for, and Expected by their Recoining the Courſe of the Moon, which is the account of the Months they keep, but they came running to the Shoar with Proviſions to wellcome and refreſh us; which were Sugar Canes, Plantons, Tortois, and ſome Fowl, and for it they received Knives, Beads, and ſuch like Trifles; and many Rowed to the Ships in the Canoes, Boats clouterly made like Troughs out of the main body of a Tree. Theſe People were naked Except a cloath to hide their Priveties, and many of them like the Antient <hi>Britains</hi> had ſcarified on their Faces, and other Parts, the Figures of Flowers, Suns, Moons, Stars, Birds, Beaſts, and the like; and rings in their Noſe, which they looked on as their chief Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They are Idolaters, worſhipping the Hoſt of Heaven. The Commanders gave ſome of them Wine, that came aboard, which they Eagerly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted, but a little ſoon made them Drunk, and kick up their heels on the Decks, as being only uſed to drink Water, and a Liquor that Diſtills out of the Plantain Tree. Yet for all this kindneſs, we could not but ſuſpect they Murthered two of our men, who went into the Woods to gather wild Fruit, for tho' we ſearched and ſtayed for them, they returned not, nor could be found, which made the reſt more cautious to venture too far.</p>
               <p>Leaving this Iſland we Sailed within ſight of the Land of <hi>Puerto Rico,</hi> and then of St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> a very large Iſland, and here the Ships ſeparated to the ſeveral Ports they were bound, as <hi>Havana, Honduras, Jucatan,</hi> and others; yet we kept toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 4 Sail, being bound for the <hi>Mexicaian</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57084:104"/> and came into the Sound, where we found the Sun, it being in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> exceeding hot, and afflicted us the more becauſe we were becalmed, and one of the Sailers in the Evening leaping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea to cool himſelf by Swiming, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately ſeized on by a Monſterous Fiſh, which they called a Tiburon, a kind of Crocadil, that pulled him under Water, and devoured him; who's ſurprizing Tragedy became a warning to the reſt, yet hoping to be revenged, we let down two large Hooks, faſtned back to back, with a ſtrong Rope, and Baited with a ſtone of fleſh, and took one of theſe Fiſh, but not the Murderer, as we found by his Gorge, when we opened him; he was as much as Sixteen men could Hawl on the Deck, tho' they let down a nooſe Rope under him to hold him faſt hampered; he proved to be 12 yards long, and being killed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cut him up, and ſalted part of his fleſh, which had ſomething of the Taſt of Beef in it, being very firm and hard; and ſoon after a freſh gale Springing up, and we had ſailed a few Leagues, the man at the Topmaſt-head cryed out, Land, which did not a little rejoyce us, for the hot weather on thoſe broad Seas had rendred us faint and ſickly, but it being near Sunſet, and the Coaſt dangerous to enter on in the night time, we lay off till the next morning, and then ſtood into a part rockey on either ſide, and preſently diſcovered it to be <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Crux,</hi> otherwiſe called St. <hi>John d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lliua,</hi> and came ſo near in 6 Fathom Water, that by a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we faſtned our Ship, that entered foremoſt by Cable Ropes, to the Rings that were placed for that purpoſe in the Wall of the Fort, which we ſaluted with our Guns. In this place <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Cortz,</hi> the famous <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain, firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, when he made his Conqueſts in <hi>Mexico,</hi> ſinking his Ships that his Souldiers might be the more reſolute in the undertaking, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all hopes of returning cut off, and with a Handful of men did ſuch Exploits, that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57084:104"/> made the World Amazed, and this being the Port to which our Ships were bound we went Aſhoar.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>Travels from St.</hi> John D' Ulha <hi>to the great City of</hi> Mexico, <hi>deſcribing the Towns in the Way, Countries lying about them; with many other things and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Antient and Modern; from the firſt Conqueſt made by the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>to this preſent time.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE proper name of this Sea-port Towns is St. <hi>John d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lha,</hi> the other <hi>Vera Crux,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given to it from the old Haven or Harbour of <hi>Vera Crux,</hi> lying 6 Leagues from it; for that proving dangerous for Ships to ride at Anchor in, by reaſon of the violent North Winds, it was forſaken, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> removed hither, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſafe by the means of a Rock which skreens off that Wind: and here were the firſt Majeſtrates, Judges, Aldermen and Officers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice named. Great was the Concourſe of the People when we landed, and the Religious, who have Monaſteries here, received us in proceſſion, becauſe they underſtood there were ſome Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries on board, ſent out of <hi>Spain</hi> to aſſiſt in converting the <hi>Indians,</hi> and upon the Account of ſome of them, who took particular notice of me, during the Voyage. I had a very good Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed me, and great Feaſting was made with ſtore of Fowl and Fiſh, of which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57084:105"/> is very plentiful, and as a laſt Courſe Sweet meats and Chocolett were brought in; <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung in the Cathedral Church, and ſome Shows preſented, but my mind being bent an other way, I little minded theſe things.</p>
               <p>I reſted the day of Landing with my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the next took a ſurvey of the Town, and places about it; I compaſſed it in 3 quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an hour, and found the Scituation to be on Sandy ground, except on the South Weſt, where it is Mooriſh, and full of noiſome Bogs at a little diſtance, which in hot weather cauſes it to be ſomewhat unhealthy: the People in it are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Rich, and the Inhabitants may, as near as I could compute, be between 3 or 4000. The Houſes, Churches and Cloiſters are moſtly built with Timber, the Streets are few, yet have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe by narrow Lanes, or other paſſages; ſo that it has been often much Indamaged by Fire: The Trade is conſiderable there from <hi>Mexico,</hi> as being the convenienteſt part alſo from <hi>Cuba</hi> St. <hi>Domingo, Jucatan, Portoello,</hi> and by the way of the latter from <hi>Peru, Cartagena,</hi> and all the Iſlands lying on the North Sea. There is a Caſtle on the Entrance, founded on a Rock, and another Rock that makes the Entrance of ſhipping unacquainted with the Harbour very difficult each are the chiefeſt Strength of the Town, and under theſe the Ships lie ſafe at Anchor, ſheltred againſt the fury of the North Wind, which is many times there very violent, ſo that the Houſes in the Town Rock and Totter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, that the Strangers conclude they are fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their Heads.</p>
               <p>The next day I found a great many Mules brought by the Owners to be Lett, to ſuch as had a mind to leave the place and Travel further. I embraced this opportunity, and ſent on Board to bring my Baggage on Shoar, which I Laded on one of them, and retained another to ride on; and ſo taking leave of thoſe whoſe Buſineſs or Curioſity detain'd them longer, I ſet forward to viſit <hi>Mexico,</hi> a famed
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57084:105"/> City, and the chiefeſt in theſe parts, but at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance from St. <hi>John de Vellun.</hi> The Road from hence for three or four Leagues I found very Sandy, but open and convenient for Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and without meeting with any thing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, I came to <hi>Oldvera Crux,</hi> Inhabited by <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> and <hi>Indians;</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> met us a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way from the Town, and offered us all the kind reſpect imaginable, ſounding their ruſtick Muſicks, and Dancing before us, Tuning their Voices, which was more Melodious than their Muſick; and indeed entring the place, we were very civily receiv'd as Strangers, the people crowding to ask what News from <hi>Spain,</hi> and of the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> we ſatisfy'd their Curioſity as well as the time would permit, and then they brought us Flowers and Sweet-meats, and we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them with divers <hi>European</hi> trifles, of which they ſeem'd very fond, rather for the ſake of whence they came than for their value.</p>
               <p>They Conducted us to the Market-place, which is in the middle of the Town, and made Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of green Boughs under two large ſpreading Elmes, for us to repoſe in and refreſh our ſelves, and thither brought us plenty of Sweet-meats, Diet-bread, and Chocolet, having before placed Tables and Benches for the purpoſe, and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> particularly Aſſembled about us in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, welcoming us into the Country. This place is but of indifferent Building, and not of any conſiderable Trade, for want of a good Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; the Buildings are of Wood; and here I obſerve the Friars have a great Command over the people, for what they order them they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately do, rendring to them profound Honours and Reſpects Having refreſhed our ſelves here, we gave the people Thanks for their Civility, and ſo took leave, reaching a little before Night a ſmall <hi>Indian</hi> Town, where we Lodged, and found very good Entertainment of Turkeys, Hens, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and Fruits.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:57084:106"/>
               <p> The next Town of Note we came to was <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lappadela Vera Crux,</hi> Conſiſting of about 2000 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> This Town is a Biſhop's See, ſtanding in a Fruitful Soil, yielding ſtore of <hi>Indian</hi> Wheat, called <hi>Maize,</hi> and ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wheat; it is encompaſſed with <hi>Indian</hi> Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, Farms of Sugar, Cochinil, and Paſtures, that breed a great many Mules, and other Cattel in the Town; there is a large Church and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, both belonging to a Cloyſter of <hi>Franciſcan-Friars,</hi> who live very looſely conſidering the Vows they make when they enter into that Order, living Riotouſly, and forgetting Chaſtity, many of them living more like Gentlemen of great Eſtates, than Men under the ridged ſeverity of the Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they profeſs.</p>
               <p>The next place we Arrived at was <hi>Lu Rinconda,</hi> which is only a kind of a Carevan-fair, or Inn, yet here we found ſtore of Proviſion, and particularly, pleaſant Spring-water, which much refreſhed us, conſidering the Heat we endured, for it being the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> the Weather was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſultry in this Valley; the Countrey about it ſhowed very Green and Pleaſant, Conſiſting of a great number of Farms, producing Corn paſture, and Fruits; but Lodging here in the Night time, we were terribly peſtered with the Gnats that ſtung us intolerably, ſo that when we riſe we ſcarce knew each other, though at Sun-Riſing they go away in ſwarms, and come not again till after Sun-Set; we paſſed ſome Villages that Day, and by Night reached a Town called <hi>Segura,</hi> Inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> to the number of 1000. <hi>Hernando Cartez</hi> Built this Town as a Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, on the firſt progreſs of his Conqueſts in <hi>Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico,</hi> againſt the <hi>Cullicacans</hi> and <hi>Tepeacus,</hi> who were Confederates with the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> and much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the beginning of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, taking 12 of them, Sacrificing them to their Idol, and then made a merry Feaſt of their Fleſh, for which <hi>Cortez</hi> aſſiſted by the <hi>Claxcullan Indians</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:57084:106"/> took <hi>Tepeacus</hi> by force, and brought them with all their Territories under ſubjection to <hi>Spain,</hi> Condemning them to perpetual Slavery, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for the Murther of his <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came likewiſe the <hi>Cullucacans,</hi> deſtroying their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and forcing the chiefeſt of them to attend him as his Servants or Slaves; here we found ſtore of Plantains, Sappotes, and Chicoſapotes, which are Fruits of a pleaſant taſte, very juicy and ſweet, alſo fair Cluſters of Grapes, ſo that here, and in many other parts of the Countrey, if Vineyards were allowed to be Planted, they would produce as good Wine, if not better, than that of <hi>Spain,</hi> but the <hi>Spainiſh</hi> Kings have prohibited it, leaſt it ſhould hinder the Trade between the two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; for indeed except Wine, <hi>Spain</hi> affords them little but what they have among them, or might reaſonably be contented without.</p>
               <p>Out of the Road to <hi>Mexico,</hi> a little <hi>Weſtward,</hi> ſtands the famous Town of the <hi>Tlaxcallans,</hi> who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Alliance with <hi>Cortez,</hi> were faithful Friends to him in his Wars, after they had tryed his ſtrength, helping him to atchieve thoſe Victories, which for a long time ſcarce could be credited in <hi>Europe,</hi> for they perceiving their numerous Forces, could not prevail againſt his handful of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> concluded them to be Gods, and conſequently innumerable, becauſe neither of their two Arrows they carried on their Standard took Effect, though ſhot in, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of them, they having a Prophecy, that when they miſſed, the Victory would always go againſt them. Upon which, after many bloody Battles wherein they loſt 40 or 50000 of their Men, they ſubmitted, and became ever after conſtant friends to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and utter Enemies to <hi>Monte Zuma,</hi> then Emperor of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and his Succeſſor; and by their aſſiſtance, <hi>Cortez</hi> took that great City, and many other places, for which this Town had greater Priviledges allowed it, than any other in <hi>Judea:</hi> This Province of <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> had then 28 Towns and Villages depending on it, cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ining
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57084:107"/> 150000 Families, which are now moſtly inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Spaniards;</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> in this part being kept under, and very poor, having little other wealth than the Corn, called <hi>Centli,</hi> though in the Town of <hi>Tlaxcallan,</hi> there are Artifficers of both Nations, and the <hi>Indians</hi> out-do the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in making cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Earthen-ware, working in Gold, Silver, Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and other Manufactures. A little before one comes to this Town, there is the Ruins of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Wall that ſtood as a Boundard, and Strangers were forbidden to paſs it on pain of being Sacrificed in their Temples to the Idols, of which they had great Numbers, and for no other fault, <hi>Cortez</hi>'s Men underwent this Fate. <hi>Tlaxcallan</hi> is pleaſantly ſeated, there is ſtill a great Market kept in it, where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 5 or 10000 People aſſembled. It has ſeveral Churches and Chaples in it and Cloiſters of <hi>Tari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who grow rich out of the labour of the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> ſome being imployed to fetch them Wood, Water, and to Fiſh for them, being paid at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick charge of the reſt. The two Streets of <hi>Ocote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulco</hi> and <hi>Fizatian</hi> are very fair, and the beſt inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited of any other: the Town is not fortified, as indeed few in the <hi>Spaniſh Indies</hi> are, except the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that are apt to be inſulted by the Buckaniers; the building is low, and very indifferent, it is a Seat of the chief Officers of Juſtice ſent from <hi>Spain</hi> every three Years, who is called the <hi>Alcalde Major,</hi> whoſe power extends to all the Towns within 20 Leagues circumference. The <hi>Indians</hi> likewiſe have among themſelves <hi>Alcaldes Regidores,</hi> and <hi>Alguaziles</hi> ſuperiour and inferiour Officers of Juſtice, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yearly by the <hi>Alcalde Major,</hi> who keep them in awe, fleecing them at their pleaſure, and exacting their ſervice without any ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Keeping on one way, we came to a City called by the <hi>Spaniards, la Puebla de les Angeles,</hi> or the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Angels:</hi> I viſited this City during my ſtay, and found it very Rich, being peſtered with Cloiſters and Monaſteries, which is a ſign of Wealth, for in poor Towns they rarely ſettle. It is ſeated in a low
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57084:107"/> and pleaſant Valley, about 3 Leagues from a very ſteep Mountain, always covered with Snow, though the Heat in the Valley is very great; it was firſt Built and Inhabited in the Year 1530. being 20 Leagues from <hi>Mexico;</hi> it is a Biſhop's Sea, and his Revenue is yearly about 20000 Duccats, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are accounted between 10 and 12000. They carry on a fine Cloth Manufacture there, which is ſent over all the <hi>Indies,</hi> being as good as that of <hi>Segovia</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> there is a Glaſs-Houſe and a Mint, wherein is Coined moſt of the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that comes from <hi>Sacatecat,</hi> to be ſent to <hi>Spain;</hi> it has curious Gardens about it, repleniſhed with Fruits, Flowers, and Fountains, and the Fields that Encloſe them are very pleaſant, abounding with Wheat and Sugar Farms.</p>
               <p>Continuing our Journey after a conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, we paſſed through many pleaſant Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, leaving conſiderable Towns on either hand to <hi>Guaco Cingo,</hi> Inhabited by <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indies,</hi> to the number of 6 or 700. There is in it a Cloyſter of <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friars. This place is like <hi>Tlaxcallian,</hi> has many Privileges granted by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe it Confederated with <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tez,</hi> againſt <hi>Montezuma.</hi> The Friars here Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained us with Singing and Dancing, boaſting that they had brought up ſeveral of the Town to do it, ſome of which they produced, and made them Dance to their Gittars with Caſtinets, and this we found to be the laſt Town of note, till we came to <hi>Mexico,</hi> which lies about 30 Miles from the way, up and down, over riſing Hills and deſcending Valleys, with a mighty high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain before us, that overlooks <hi>Mexico,</hi> and the vaſt Lake it is Seated on.

XXIII. <hi>My Arrival at</hi> Mexico; <hi>a Deſcriptien of that famed City, what it has been, and what at preſent it is; the manner of Building; nature of its Inhabitants; Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and plenty of the Mountains, Lakes, and places about it,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>AFter a tedious Journey, being Arrived at the great City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> the Head of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern <hi>Spaniſh Indies,</hi> I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more particularly of it, than of other places I paſſed through, as to what it now is, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral as to what it has been, in its moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſplendor.</p>
               <p>This City is large in Compaſs, and ſtands on two Lakes, which ſome have concluded to be but one, becauſe of their nearneſs and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57084:108"/> of their Waters, but they appear different in three things particularly; <hi>viz.</hi> one ebbs and flows by the force of the North-Wind, and the other does not; the Water of the one is Sweet, the other is Salt and Brackiſh; one has great ſtore of Fiſh, and the other is deſtitute of any, though they have both their ſource or Springs that feed them from the great Mountain that overlooks the City. The Houſes in this City are Built more ſtately, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of the Nobility and Gentry, than in other places; the Vice-Roy of the <hi>Mexacanian</hi> Province has his Palace here, and ſo has the Arch-Biſhop. The Churches are many, Founded moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Heathen Temples, which were in the flouriſhing ſtate of the City, very numerous, and had Pyramides in the Midſt of a vaſt height, on which the Idols ſtood, to whom they offered Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood in Sacrifice, and ſprinkled the Walls and Pillars of the Idol-Altar with it; there are in the City ſeveral Spacious Streets, and great Markets, affording all ſorts of Proviſions and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Neceſſaries. The Lakes by reaſon of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Boats and Canoes that Trade on them, furniſh the City with ſtore of plenty, eſpecially with multitudes of Fowl and Fiſh taken there, the former being allured by a certain Oily tough Scum on the Water, which they eat as Food; beſides there are many Trading Towns on the Banks where the Boats take in Loading, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſupply the City. The Monaſteries and Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries are a graceful Ornament to the reſt, their being almoſt of all the Orders. The Churches have Curious Spires, with Guilded Croſſes on their Tops and the whole Fabrick's Built with Stone of rare Architecture. Water comes almoſt into all parts of the City, by ſmall Conduits, for though the Streets were formerly watered by Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels from the Lake, they are now moſtly ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up, and firm Ground made where Houſes are Built; for after the Conqueſt, <hi>Cortez</hi> divided the Ground where the Houſes had been Conſumed
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57084:109"/> by Fire, or void ſpaces, were ſome to the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and ſome to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and free Leave was given by Proclamation, for every one to come in and Build, ſo that it was ſoon Rebuilt; but ſince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have in a manner diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the <hi>Indians</hi> of their part; for though many Live in the City, yet are they obliged to hire the Houſes at dear Rates, that were formerly by Grant from the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> their lawful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonies, or Inheritance. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> Built their Houſes in their own Faſhion, and the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> theirs according to the cuſtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. <hi>Cortez</hi> Built his where King <hi>Montezumas</hi>'s ſtately Palace ſtood, which in the Siege had been conſumed with Fire, and a vaſt number of Wild Beaſts of all ſorts that he kept there in Wooden Cages Burnt in it, lamentably roaring and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as the Fire approached them; and this Houſe is the moſt ſtately in the City, being the Seat of the Vice-Roy of all the Province, and is called the Palace of the <hi>Marqueſs d' Valla,</hi> for that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the King of <hi>Spain</hi> conferred on <hi>Cortez,</hi> after he had obtained his amazing Victories, over ſuch a mighty Nation, conſidering his Forces were but a handful of <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but that which ſeemed in all humane probability to give him ſucceſs were the Bullets, and Chain-Shot, proceeding from his Thundring Artillery, for the <hi>Indians</hi> unacquainted with ſuch Engines, took their roaring and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing flame to be the Voice of the Angry Gods that fought againſt them, and when the Shot made Lanes among them, they took them for their Thunderbolts, or deſtroying Angels, ſent as Meſſengers of their vengeance, to cut them off, not thinking any thing in nature could be of ſo violent a force, as to beat down Ranks of Men before them with ſuch ſwiftneſs that the Eye could ſcarce trace the Deaths they gave. This, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Armour proof againſt their Arrows, made their Courage ſtoop and languiſh though otherways a Valiant people, as appears by their diſputing it in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57084:109"/> the City from Street to Street, and fortifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with intrenchments as they Retreated, tho' by the Sword, Peſtilence, and Famine, 10000 or more, lay Dead within the Walls. In this War <hi>Montezuma</hi> was Slain by his own Subjects, againſt their Wills, for being taken Priſoner, when multitudes of <hi>Indians</hi> aſſaulted the Palace, where <hi>Cortez</hi> and his <hi>Spaniards</hi> were, he was conſtrained to go to a Ball<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony, or Battlement, to deſire his Subjects to deſiſt, and come to a Parley, when one of the inraged multitude not knowing him in the hurry, ſtruck him with a ſharp Flint on the Temples, which wounded him ſo much that he fell down, and ſoon after Died; yet at that time <hi>Cortez</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retire out of the City, to ſtrengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in <hi>Flaxcallan,</hi> and at his ſecond time took it, by the help of the Vergantines, or Veſſels he Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged it with, on the ſide of the Lake, which ſtopping up all paſſage for Relief, Famine, and its attendant Peſtilence, proved their worſt Enemy, yet ſubmitted they not, but diſputed it, as I have ſaid, till <hi>Quahutimo C—</hi>their New King, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things brought to the laſt extreamity, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to fly by way of the Lake, was ſurprized by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Veſſels, and made Priſoner, at that time by <hi>Cortez</hi>'s perſwaſion (who would not give him his Wiſh to kill him, tho' he deſired it,) Commanded his Men to lay down their Arms, and then about 60000 came out of their ſtrength and ſubmitted, have Lived a long time on the Fleſh of the Slain; yet Famine notwithſtanding had ſo pinched them, that they looked like the ſhadows of Men, Lean, Meager, and very Gaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Over again the Palace, they Built Arched Docks, to lay up the <hi>Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gantines,</hi> in perpetual memory of the notable Service they had done; but they are moſtly waſted by Time; and other Veſſels Trading on the Lake are in the wet Seaſon laid up there. However this Great City is ſometimes unhealthful, for as much as there ariſes at certain
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57084:110"/> times a noyſom Vapour from the Lake, and at thoſe times the Winds blow little to purge the Air, becauſe of the Incloſure of Mountains. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> a long time ſtood on their Guard, after the taking of <hi>Mexico,</hi> the Citizens keeping 2000 Horſe and Arms, for Horſe-Men, always to be in a readineſs when the Trumpet ſhould ſound; but by what they have conſumed of the <hi>Indians</hi> in their Mines, and in working on the Lake, in making great Intrenchments, other Works, and particularly, by their Cruelty, they have ſo far exhauſted them, that thoſe Forces are laid aſide, and they live ſecure without fear of ſurprize; for the City lies open in moſt parts, and in all defenceleſs, except the ſtrength of the Inhabitans being deſtitute of Bullwarks and other conſiderable Fortifications, tho' an exceeding Rich City, and the Lading of 20 or more Ships are brought yearly to it, by the way of the North Sea, containing the beſt and Richeſt Commodities of <hi>Spain,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> bought up by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to this purpoſe, and from the South-Sea it Trafficks with <hi>Perue;</hi> it Trades alſo with ſeveral Eaſtern Nations, by way of the <hi>Pilipinas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Money is daily Coined in the Mint to a great value, the Silver being brought on Mules from the Mines of St. <hi>Lewis de Saccatecas,</hi> about 80 Leagues more Northward, and beyond them the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by Conqueſt, and the voluntary ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Natives, have gained the poſſeſſion of very large Countries. There is in this City a Univerſity, which was formerly only a School. The Officers here are as in the great Cities of <hi>Spain,</hi> and it is Computed to have in the City and Suburbs 50000 Houſes, and to the latter, called <hi>Guadalupe,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> are moſtly confined. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> Styling themſelves abſolute Conquerors and Diſpoſers of their Perſons and Fortunes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very proud and inſulting over them, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror among them being termed a Title of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſo that the moſt Beggarly among the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:57084:110"/> will proudly boaſt to be deſcended from one of the firſt Conquerors, and Style himſelf a Don, though he has not one Foot of Land in Poſſeſſion. There are many fair Gardens and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards about this City, with pleaſant Summer-Fountains, and other things ſuitable for recreation in them.</p>
               <p>The Buildings are with Stone and Brick, but not high, to prevent their being ſhaken, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown by Earthquakes, that often happen in this Country. In the narroweſt Streets 3 Coaches may go abreſt, and in the broadeſt 6; They keep a vaſt number of Coaches here, ſome account them 15000. thoſe of the Nobility and Gentry very ſtately, overlayed with Gold or Silver, and the Corners emboliſhed with Precious Stone, Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Mother-pearl, the Lining and Seats are Cloth of Gold, Silver, or <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Silks. The Shops are every where ſtored with Rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, and by this you may gueſs at their Riches and dexterity in Workmanſhip. A Vice-Roy of <hi>Mexico, Anno</hi> 1625. ſent the then King of <hi>Spain</hi> the repreſentation of a Poppinſay, a Bird bigger than a Pheſant of <hi>Meltal,</hi> and Precious Stones, ſo artificially placed, as to repreſent us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Colours, and all parts very lively, and it was eſtimated at half a Million of Duccats. In the Church belonging to the Cloyſter of <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> is a Silver Lamp, curiouſly wrought, with 300 Branches, beſide 100 little Lamps for Oyl ſet in it, each of different Workmanſhip, valued at 400000 Duccats, and with ſuch like curious Works are the Streets made Rich and Beautiful from the Shops of Goldſmiths. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are here very Beautiful, and take a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter liberty than allowed in <hi>Spain,</hi> in Gaming, Drinking, and making Viſits; nay, they will from their Windows, or Ballconies, invite Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as they paſs the Streets, to play at Primera, and other Games, and ſuch as accept the offer are plentifully Feaſted with Wine, Sweet-meats,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57084:111"/> and other Dainties, though this ſometimes prove fatal, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> though ſo far removed, have not altogether forgot the imbred Jealouſie of their <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Anceſtors, who brought it out of <hi>Spain</hi> with them. Many of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Marry with the <hi>Indian</hi> Women, and beget a race called <hi>Mollotos,</hi> of a Tawney Complection; nor ſpare they to take away the <hi>Indian</hi>'s Wives, if they like them better than their own; they boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the poor credulous Natives to be the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianteſt and moſt Accompliſh'd Men in the World, and that all Nations Tremble at the Name of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and by this, and other Artifices, they keep them in great awe and ſubjection, aſſuring them, that no Nation under Heaven is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them out of their Hands, or in Battel to ſtand before them.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Attire, the Faſhion alters not here, but it is with the better ſort exceſſive Rich, and the meaneſt will go as Fine as poſſible, though other Neceſſities crave the ſparing of it. The beſt Silks, Damask, Cloath of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Embroideries of Pearl and Precious Stones, are commonly worn amongſt them: nay, among Trades-people, a Blackamoor, or Tawney Young Maid, will make a hard ſhift to be in the Faſhion, with a Neck-Lace or Chain of Gold, Bracelets of Pearl, and Ear-bobs of large Pearl or Precious Stone; and though their Garments are very Rich, yet they overlay them with Gold, Silver-Lace, or Embroidery of Gold and Silver, and theſe ſort of Wenches are allowed or wincked at to be Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans or Common Women, to ſatisfie the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> Venery, to which they are inſatiably gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and they have allways change of Apparel, eſpecially for Summer and Winter, though the Winter here conſiſts only in terrible Rains, and the overflowing of Lakes and Rivers, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nundations, occaſioning many times the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Houſes, People, and Cattel, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſome Months. They are here very Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57084:111"/> both <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> for at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of the Prieſts they make exceſſive Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the Shrines of Saints, as Crowns of Gold, Bracelets, Precious Stones, Veſſels of Silver and Gold, ſo that the Monaſteries and Churches may well be ſaid to enjoy the Profits and Pleaſures of a Golden World; for their Revenues, or yearly Incomes, are more than in any part of <hi>Europe;</hi> nor do theſe Eccleſiaſticks tie themſelves to the ſtrictneſs of the Rules of their Orders, but paſs away the time in divers Recreations. They have pleaſant Gardens, Fountains, Baths, Muſick, and plenty of Proviſion to Exceſs, ſo that this exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance or ſuper abounding of this Country, has corrupted the Manners of the begging Friars, and rendred them as ſtately as petty Princes, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, their Superiors, who ſcarcely give place to any. Their Lodgings are ſtately, and the Roofs of their Cloyſters and Churches adorned with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick Work and Guildings of Gold; ſome Altars are of Maſſive Gold, others of Silver, Pillars of Brazil, and Marble of little eſteem among them; and this Glorious ſhew of Pomp and Grandure draws the poor <hi>Indians</hi> to Admire and Adore them, though before their Heathen Temples were very Magnificent, but not comparable to theſe. They have Tabernacles of Gold and Silver, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial, and other precious things to enſhrine and carry the Hoſt about in Proceſſion; ſo that I may well ſay, the Riches of the greateſt King or Potentate I have yet ſpoken of, may in ſome degree of Magnificence fall ſhort of what I ſaw here, if I take the Clergy among the Laity.</p>
               <p>In the Market-Place of this City, which is very Spacious, there are Arched Piazza's, and Shops furniſhed with Coſtly Wares, and before their Shops are all manner of curious Fruits Sold, that the Country affords; the Arches of the Vice-Roy's Palace, with the Walks of the Houſe, and the Garden, belonging to it, takes up almoſt one ſide of the Market; at the end of it is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57084:112"/> Priſon, ſtrongly Built of Stone, and next it the Beautiful Street called <hi>La Pateria,</hi> or <hi>the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths-ſtreet;</hi> where are to be ſeen the value of many Millions in Plate and Jewels. The Street of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is very fair, where they Trade moſtly in Silks. <hi>Tabuca</hi> is the longeſt and broadeſt, where moſtly are Shops vending Iron-ware, Braſs, and Steel, made into things fit for uſe and Service, and this is of very ſtately Building. In the Street <hi>Del Aquilla,</hi> the Houſes of the Gentry are moſtly ſeated. It is called ſo from an Eagle of Stone placed there, upon the Conqueſt of the City. There is a kind of a Park, or void place, ſhaded with Trees, where the Gallants and Ladies with their Trains and Equipages air themſelves in the Evening, and here much miſchief is done by quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, upon the account of Jealouſie in Courtſhip, and hundreds of Swords at a time have been drawn, to Revenge or reſcue a Revenger, and carry him off to Sanctuary, where being once Lodged, he is out of the power of the Law; yet after all, the Lake at preſent much undermines the City, for that the Springs permit but of few Cellars; in laying in Dead Bodies the Coffins are half cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Water, and many of the ſtately Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſink, ſo that they are forced often to repair their Foundations, by laying new ones on the old, that ſeem as it were to be ſwallowed up in a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
               <p>This City has but 3 ways to come into it by Cauſey, the one is from the Weſt, and that is a Mile and half long; another from the North, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 3 Miles; on the Eaſt there is no entrance by Land, but on the South the Cauſey is 5 Miles in length, and by this laſt way <hi>Cortez</hi> entred when he made his Conqueſt of it.</p>
               <p>About this City, as well as in other places, are divers kinds of delicate Fruits, as the Nuchili of divers Colours, a Fruit which eaten, ſtains like Black-Cherries, and colours the Urine as red as Blood, ſo that Strangers unacquainted with its
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57084:112"/> quality, really fancy they void Blood; this put the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into great frights at their firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and their Phyſicians being ignorant of the Operation applied Remedies to ſtanch Blood, till the <hi>Indians</hi> gave them to underſtand better; the skin of them are thick, and full of ſmall prickles, which touching the Lips ſtick in them, and make them for a time ſtick together, ſo that the Voice will faulter, but this skin is eaſily pealed off, and then the Fruit appears of a Scarlet Red. There are alſo Apples, Pears, Quinces, Pomegranets, Musk-mellions, Cheſs-Nuts, Wall-Nuts, Figs, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Oranges, Citron, and abundance of other Fruits, known in <hi>Europe.</hi> But one Tree more Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable than the reſt, not known amongſt us, the Metel, which they Plant and dreſs as they do their Vines. It hath near 40 kinds of Leaves grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it, which ſerve for divers uſes; for, when very tender, they make Conſerves of them, when more grown, Paper, Flax, Mantles, Shoes, Mats, Girdles, and Cordage; on other Leaves grow Prickles ſo ſtrong, that placing them in Frames of Wood they make ſaws of them; from the Root there cometh a Juice like unto Syrrup, which by heat is made into Sugar; they make of it alſo Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and a ſort of Wine, that ſtupifies the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to Drunkenneſs. The Rhin'd roaſted heals Sores and Ulcers, applying Poltiſces to them; and from the uppermoſt Branches diſtills a Gum, which diſſolved in Wine, Antidotes Poyſon: And to conclude with this City, there is nothing in or about it wanting, to make it happy; but the Temper of the people, who are reſtleſs, in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey flowing with all Delights Nature or Art can afford them in any degree.</p>

               <p>HAving thus Travelled to <hi>Mexico,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it as particularly as Proſpect and Enquiry could inform me; I now undertake briefly to do the like of the Country of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> as far as it is yet known to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> or <hi>Indians,</hi> I converſed with thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>The chief Diviſion therefore of this great part of the World is two fold, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Mexicanian,</hi> and <hi>Peruanian</hi> Provinces. <hi>Mexico</hi> gives name to the greater half of <hi>America,</hi> and is called <hi>Nova Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> or <hi>New Spain,</hi> from whence the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> Style themſelves <hi>Hiſaniour Reges.</hi> The <hi>Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican</hi> Track containeth chiefly the Northern Parts, comprehending many large Provinces, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, already known, and many not yet well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, as the parts that lie between it to the Northern or Frozen-Sea, <hi>viz. Mexico, Quivira, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caragna, Jucatan, Flerida virgina, Norumbega, Nova, Francia, Corteralis, Eſtoliland,</hi> and ſome others, ſo that the Compaſs of this part already known is at leaſt 23000 Miles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Peruanan</hi> part contains all the Southern Track, tied to the <hi>Mexican</hi> by the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> or
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57084:113"/> ſtreight of <hi>Darien,</hi> being between 12 and 17 Miles over in ſome parts, from the Northern to the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Sea. This part contains the Provinces, or Kingdoms, of <hi>Caſtella, Aurea, Gunia, Peru, Braſil, Chille,</hi> in compaſs about 17000 Miles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mexico,</hi> as I obſerved, abounds with Gold ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rivers, producing many devouring Crocadils, tho' not ſo big as thoſe in the <hi>Nile</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which the poorer ſort of the <hi>Indians</hi> take and feed on their Fleſh, as a great dainty. There are ſeveral Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains caſting fourth Flames of Fire in it, as <hi>Pepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champeche, Popocatapec,</hi> and others, nay, all the <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> parts, as far as <hi>Leon</hi> in <hi>Nicaragua</hi> produces ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, but the latter I have named, is one of the chief; it ſtands 8 Leagues from <hi>Chollola,</hi> it is a ſteep rockey Mountain. Ten <hi>Spaniards</hi> attended with <hi>Indians</hi> to carry their Water and Victuals, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to take a Survey of it, and approached ſo near the top, that they heard a terrible noiſe, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Erruption of Fire; then the ground ſhaked ſo terribly, that they durſt not approach no nearer, however, they perceived the Vulcan or Cavety whence the Fire Iſſued half a League in compaſs out, which Air and Fire proceeded, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with a terrible Noiſe, Shrill and Whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſo that the whole Hill trembled, and the top near this Mouth was covered with Aſhes, about knee-deep, and as they were viewing it, ſuch a ſhower of Fire fell, that had they not ſtept under the craggy over-hanging of a Rock, they had there been roaſted to Death; but in an hour or two, it clearing up, they haſted down much affrighted, but without any harm: This Mountain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of <hi>Hernando Cartez,</hi> had for ten Years diſſiſted ſending forth Flames, and when it began again according to a prediction among them, the <hi>Indians</hi> looked for ſome great miſery to befall them by change of Government. The Aſhes blown in the Air, are many times ſcattered 10 Leagues from the foot of the Mountain.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:57084:114"/>
               <p> This chief Province, called <hi>Mexico,</hi> is further divided into ſix Parts, <hi>viz. Themiſtian, Nova-galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Mechoacan</hi> and <hi>Gauſtachan;</hi> the firſt is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and greateſt, containing ſix Cities, of which the principal is the rich City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> the Seats of an Archbiſhop and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Viceroy; the next is <hi>la Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la de los Angeles;</hi> the third <hi>Vellazuca;</hi> the fourth <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquera;</hi> the fifth <hi>Mexcioca;</hi> the ſixth <hi>Ottopan,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe there are a great number of Villages, or large unwalled Towns on the Roads and Borders of Rivers and Lakes, inhabited by <hi>Indians, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Meſtizoes,</hi> a mixed Generation of <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

               <p>Near <hi>Mexico,</hi> is <hi>Tacuba,</hi> a pleaſant Town inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Gardens; in the way to <hi>Chapultepec,</hi> is <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luco,</hi> a Town much traded to, and in the Woods breed Hogs, producing Bacon as good as our Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia. Travelling <hi>Weſtward,</hi> the Town of <hi>la Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi> preſents it ſelf at the end of a Cauſey, whether the People much reſort from <hi>Mexico,</hi> to pay Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> inriched with Crowns, Chains of Gold, and precious Stones, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at a Million of Duccats. There is a pleaſant Town bending to the <hi>North,</hi> called, <hi>la Soledad,</hi> or the <hi>Solitary Wilderneſs,</hi> where the Bare-footed <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melite</hi> Friars have their Reſidence; but if this be a Wilderneſs, few places can be accounted pleaſant, for it affords Fruits, Flowers, Shades Fountains, and every thing that can delight Mankind. And heither reſort the Nobles and Gentry to take their Pleaſure, who bring great Preſents to the Friars, ſo that they live Fat and Plentiful on the outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Sanctity; for in their Oratory, and Cells made in Rocks, they hang Whips of Wyer, Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with ſharp pricking Needles to wear next their Skin, ſhirts of Hair, and other mortifying Materials; but one of them ingeniouſly told me, they were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there more for ſhew, than uſe, to move Peoples Charity towards them, and brought them a vaſt income of Money, and all ſorts of Proviſions; and indeed though they have out of a deſign given this
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57084:114"/> place the name of a Wilderneſs, it ſeemed to me an Earthly Paradiſe. At <hi>Tadubaya,</hi> not much diſtance from this place, is a very rich Cloiſter of <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> with curious Gardens and Orchards belonging to it; they have a ſtately Church there, and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> have been taught by the Prieſts to be Choiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ſing very fine.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken ſomewhat already of the Province of <hi>Guaſtachan,</hi> which I paſſed in my Travels from St. <hi>John de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lhua,</hi> to <hi>Mexico.</hi> It is a very plentiful Country, abounding in Sugar, farms Paſture, Corn, Cochinil, reaching as far as the Valley of <hi>Guaxaca,</hi> a very rich place, but having ſpoke of the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Towns in my Paſſage, I ſhall paſs to the third Province, called <hi>Mechoacan,</hi> which is about 80 Leagues in circumference. This Province is very rich, abounding in Mulberry-trees, which feed a great number of Silk-worms; alſo in Wax, Honey, Black Amber, divers coloured Feathers, of which they make curious Works, and the River abound with ſtore of Fiſh. The chief City of this Province is <hi>Valodolid,</hi> a Biſhop's See; the Towns of Note are <hi>Sinſonte,</hi> which before the Conqueſt, was the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the <hi>Indian</hi> King of the Province <hi>Paſcuar</hi> and <hi>Coliman,</hi> inhabited by <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> There are alſo two good Havens, called St. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> or <hi>Santiago;</hi> the King of it, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Caconzin,</hi> was a great Friend to <hi>Cortez,</hi> and much aſſiſted him in his Wars againſt the <hi>Mexicons,</hi> will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly yielding himſelf a Vaſſal to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> though it was ill requited; for <hi>don Nunio de Guzman,</hi> firſt Ruler and Preſident of the Chancery of <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> after the Conqueſt picked a Quarrel, and made War on this Province, took the King Priſoner, who was quiet and peaceable, not ſtiring againſt him; and when he had ſtript him out of 10000 Marks in Plate, Gold, and other Riches, he inhumanly burnt him at a Stake, with divers of his Nobles and Gentry, who ſeemed to rejoyce that they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy to ſuffer with their King, and in Death bear him Company into the other World.</p>

                  <hi>Nova Galia,</hi> or the fourth Province of <hi>Mexico,</hi> is well watered with two large Rivers, <hi>viz. Piaſtle</hi> and <hi>Sanſebaſtian;</hi> it contains many great Towns of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians;</hi> the chief is <hi>Xaliſco;</hi> the next <hi>Guadalajara;</hi> the third <hi>Coaza;</hi> the fourth <hi>Corupoſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la;</hi> the fifth St. <hi>Eſpirit;</hi> the ſixth <hi>Capala,</hi> now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Nova Mexico,</hi> a Frontier on the <hi>Northern Indians,</hi> from whence the <hi>Spaniards</hi> frequently make Inroads and War upon them, and much incroach that way, to the great Waſt and Deſtruction of thoſe poor People, who would live in quiet, and do good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> if they might be permitted; but their thirſt after the Mines of Gold and Silver, they ſuppoſe to be in that Country, and not yet diſcovered, is the main incitement that makes them puſh their Swords ſo violently that way, though they often meet with their Match; for theſe naked People are very Warlike, and in their flights after a Diſcharge of their Vollies of Poiſon Arrows, chamber up and run upon the Rocks like Wild Goats; their dwellings are for the moſt part in the Woods, where they make Swamps, and fortified places of Timber and other Materials, rudely piled and faſtned one to another, and that which incites the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo eagarly, to poſſeſs themſelves by Conqueſts of theſe <hi>Northern</hi> parts, beſides the Treaſure they find in them, is, out of Miſtruſt or Jealouſie, leaſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from <hi>Virginia,</hi> and other Collonies, ſhould be induſtrious in ſubduing and ſteping in before them.</p>
               <p>Thus having briefly run over the chief <hi>Mexicon</hi> Provinces, under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominion, I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to take a Survey of ſome others, and in the firſt place, of <hi>Quivira,</hi> ſeated in the moſt <hi>Weſtern</hi> part of <hi>America,</hi> over againſt <hi>Tartary,</hi> from whence not being much diſtant, many ſuppoſe that this new World was firſt inh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57084:115"/> affording every where ſtore of Paſture, and thoſe that look after the Cattle, carry Tents with them for ſhelter, and dreſs their Food in the Fields as the <hi>Tartars.</hi> This, and the <hi>Southern</hi> parts of <hi>America,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be far better Peopled than that towards <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> ſo that though it is but a conjecture, yet it is a very probable one, that the firſt peopling this Country, was from <hi>Aſia,</hi> either accidentally by Ship-wrack, or driven out of their Country by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, War, or ſuch Calamities; they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſeek new Habitations, and ſo after much wandering at Sea, found out this Country, though the <hi>Indians</hi> have a tradition, which is a received Opinion amongſt many of them, that their God with Blazing Fires, lighted and guided them Day and Night, over the <hi>Northern</hi> Rocks and Mountains, covered with Ice and Snow, feeding and cheriſhing them by the way with Pulſe and other Food, when they had been oppreſſed by Gyant-like Enemies, and driven out of their former Habitations. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of theſe parts take a greater pride in Glaſs Beads, and other Trifles, than in Gold and Jewels, and are eaſily impoſed on for the Exchange of the Hides of their Cattle; they make Coverings for their homely Cottages; of their Bones they make Bodkins and Needles; of their Hair, Thread; of their Sinue, Cordage; of their Blood, Drink; and of their Fleſh, Meat; of their Horns, Paunches, and Bladders, Veſſels: Some are of Opinion, that there is a Traffick on this Coaſt from <hi>China,</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagina,</hi> from whence <hi>Vaſquez de Corovado</hi> made a Progreſs into ſome parts of it, with his Army of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which he ſaw from the Rocks, and high Mountains, on the Sea Coaſt, Ships at Sea, not of common Building, ſeeming to be well laden, and bearing in their Prows <hi>Pillicans,</hi> which could not be conjectured to come from any Country, but one of the two before named.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Quivira,</hi> there are but two Provinces that are well known to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> and thoſe are <hi>Cibola</hi> and <hi>Nova Albion Cibola Lys</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> where a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57084:116"/> City gives that Name to the Province; the next to it is called <hi>Tolontua,</hi> a pleaſant place in a very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Air, Scituated on a River of that Name; the third Town that offers is <hi>Tinguez,</hi> inhabited by <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and in it, the Jeſuits have a ſtately Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and are appointed to Preach to the <hi>Indians</hi> in thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nova Albion,</hi> lies on the <hi>West</hi> ſide towards <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> this was diſcovered in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> by the Renowned <hi>Engliſhman</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> who gave it this Name upon the King of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Surrendering his Crown of Network and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, curiouſly wrought, and ſubmitting himſelf and people to the Queen's Protection. It is in ſome parts inhabited by a few <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but not yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any conſiderable ſtore of Riches, they have not much coveted to People it, though it abounds with Fruit pleaſant to the Eye and Taſt. The People are very Curteous and Affable to Strangers, but moſtly given to their old Idolatry, practiſing Charms; and ſome affirm they dance with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil on certain mid-night Feaſts, and revels, offering him human Sacrifice. The Bounds between this <hi>Quivira</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> is <hi>Marvir Miglio,</hi> or <hi>Califor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next belonging to <hi>Mexico</hi> in the <hi>Northern</hi> Tract, is <hi>Jucalan,</hi> the firſt that Diſcovered it by <hi>Franciſco Hernandez de Cordovo,</hi> Anno 1517. who asking an <hi>Indian</hi> the name of that Country, and he not underſtanding the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> anſwer <hi>Jucatan,</hi> which in the <hi>Indian</hi> Language, is, <hi>What do you ſay,</hi> and from thence they named it, and ſo it has ever ſince been called. This Country is at leaſt 900 Miles in Circuit, and a kind of a Peninſula. It is fixed over againſt the Iſland of <hi>Cuba,</hi> and divided into three parts; <hi>Jucatan</hi> properly ſo called, which has in it the Cities of <hi>Campeche, Valadolid, Merida, Semancus,</hi> and one which for its Greatneſs and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they call <hi>Caire</hi> the chief; the Commodities here are Honey, Wax, Hides and Sugar, Cana, Fiſtula, Sarſaparila, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for Food, it produces great
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57084:116"/> ſtore of <hi>Indian Maize,</hi> and is well Watered and Wooded in all parts; the Timber is ſo good, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Build Tall-Ships there; they have ſtore of Turkeys, and other Fowl, which with other Commodities, they pay as Tribute to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for their Poſſeſſions, who keep them low and poor, which makes them apt to fall into Mutinies and Rebellions.</p>
               <p>Another part of this Track is called, <hi>Guatemala,</hi> where the Cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> has deſtroyed near a Million of the Natives; yet this Country is populous, and has many flouriſhing <hi>Indian</hi> Towns in it. The chief Cities are <hi>Guatemala, Caſſuca</hi> and <hi>Chiapa;</hi> it is well Watered with Rivers, and has ſome large Lakes full of Fiſh, and at Seaſons, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with wild Fowl; it abounds in Fruit, Corn and Cattle.</p>
               <p>The third part of <hi>Jucatan</hi> is <hi>Acaſamil,</hi> an Iſland over againſt <hi>Guatemala,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſually at this day call, <hi>Sla Cruz;</hi> it lies advantageous for a Harbour, and the advantage of Trade.</p>
               <p>The fourth Diviſion of the Northern Track un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> is <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> ſtanding South Eaſt from the City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> about 450 Leagues; yet it agrees with it in the Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the Climate, the People are of good Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, active and ſtrong, and of Complexion indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent White. Before they were brought under ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, they had ſtanding Laws, and many poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in their Government, particularly, if one rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed an other, he was not put to Death, but became his ſlave till his ſervice had made Satisfaction for the Damage done; they had no Law for the Murther of a King, as concluding none would be ſo wicked as to act ſuch Villany. This Country gives a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant proſpect, and abounds in all things neceſſary for human ſupport; here grows the famous Tree ſo much Written of, which if a man touch but one of the Branches with his Finger, it preſently whithers: There are great Flocks of Parrots, as of Crows or Pigeons in <hi>England;</hi> alſo Turkeys, Quailes, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57084:117"/> The Spaniſh Cities here have a Biſhop's See, and <hi>Granada</hi> ſtanding on a Lake of freſh Water, about 300 miles in compaſs, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Ebbs, and Flows, though it has no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the Ocean.</p>
               <p>And thus much, having thought fit to ſpeak of the <hi>Mexicon</hi> Provinces, and the Dominion of <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein I moſtly Travelled, I now come to ſpeak in their Order of the <hi>Peruanian</hi> parts, for richneſs in Gold and other Mettals.</p>
               <p>This principally contains 5 large Countries, as I have already hinted. This Southern part of <hi>India</hi> is held to be Richer than the Northern, for although it wants the conveniency of Traffick by the Northern Sea, which the other has, and is therefore obliged to ſend its Commodities to <hi>Pannama,</hi> and from thence have them Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over the Streight, or Iſthmus, by the River <hi>Chiagree,</hi> to <hi>Portabel,</hi> upon the North-Sea, yet the great ſtore of Gold, Silver, and other Mettal, make richly amends for their pains and Travel, and ſuch ſtore is found, that a Prohibition or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction is laid by the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen new Mines, till the old ones are ſufficiently wrought; the huge Mountains of <hi>Potoſi</hi> are thought to conſiſt moſtly of Gold-oar, and here grow all ſuch Fruits as are found in <hi>Spain,</hi> beſide ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others natural to the Country; the Olives are larger than thoſe of <hi>Spaia,</hi> the Oyl ſweeter and clearer, the Grapes yield Wine ſtronger than <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine, and here they have more Liberty than in <hi>Mexico</hi> to make it, becauſe it cannot be ſo well brought from <hi>Spain;</hi> they have ſtore of Wheat and other Grain, the Soil all lying under the high Mineral Mountains, being very Fruitful, the Water that deſcends fatning the Valleys, for there is but little Rain, and the Evening and Morning Dews give great refreſhment. The Vice-Roy has his Reſidence in the City of <hi>Lima,</hi> a place much ſubject to Earthquakes, and of late has been ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly ſhaken, and almoſt deſtroyed by 'em; there
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57084:117"/> is held a Court of Chancery, and it is an Arch-Biſhop's See. It is well fortified ſince the <hi>Buca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers</hi> have made ſo many Depradations and Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies on the Coaſt; two Miles from it is a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Harbour or Port, called <hi>Callau,</hi> where the Ships lie that convey the Treaſure to <hi>Panama,</hi> and other Ships that Trade to divers parts, and beſide <hi>Caſteella Aura,</hi> or <hi>Golden Caſteel. Chille</hi> is very Rich in Golden Mines, which has cauſed an obſtinate War between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> that Inhabit it, who are very hardy, and dextrous at Fire-Arms, moſt part of them being the Sons of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women by <hi>Indians,</hi> ſo that a great many of the beſt Soldiers out of the <hi>Neatherlands</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> have been ſent thither under an Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Captain, who has the Command, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for his Service in <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> by their Wars have got ſtrong footing, and are poſſeſſed of 3 principal Cities, beſide many Towns of Note, as the <hi>Conception,</hi> which is a Biſhop's See, <hi>Santjago,</hi> and <hi>Valdivia,</hi> this latter, took its Name from a Governor ſo called, whoſe thirſt of Gold through Covetouſneſs to grow Rich on a ſudden, in uſing great Oppreſſion, made the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Chille</hi> break out into a Bloody War, and ſurprizing him in his Houſe, poured melted Gold down his Throat, ſaying, <hi>Since he had ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly coveted it, he ſhould have his fill of it, and ſo much of it as ſhould laſt him all his Life-time;</hi> and accordingly it did, for the ſcalding Mettal preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killed him, but the War ended not with his Death, but has at times continued ever ſince.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Guiana</hi> and <hi>Braſil,</hi> the latter belonging to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and States of <hi>Holland,</hi> by reaſon of their remoatneſs I had not an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to Travel there, and ſince I can ſpeak little of them, than what I have from Report, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are Rich, and Flouriſhing Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; I ſhall paſs them over, and return again to <hi>Caſtella Aure,</hi> in the Southern or <hi>Peruanian</hi> Track. This containeth the North part of <hi>Peru,</hi> and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57084:118"/> part of the Iſthmus, that runneth between the North and South-Sea, and beſide the Gold in it, it is plentifully ſtored with Silver, Pearl, Spices, Medicinal Herbs, and Drugs; it is divided into 4 Provinces, the firſt is called <hi>Caſtella del oro,</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Nova Andaluzia,</hi> the third, <hi>Nova Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> the fourth, <hi>Carthagena Caſtella del oro;</hi> is Situate in the very Iſthmus, and not over peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, by reaſon of the unhealthful Air, occaſioned by the noyſom Vapours ariſing from large ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lakes, or Pools; the chief places here belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are <hi>Theomimay,</hi> or <hi>Nombre de Dias,</hi> on the Eaſt; the ſecond, which lies 6 Leagues from <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> is <hi>Portabel,</hi> chiefly Inhabited by <hi>Spaniards, Mulottos,</hi> and <hi>Blackamoors;</hi> this latter, has a very fair and goodly Haven, from whence it ſeems to derive its Name, well fortified at the Entrance with 3 Caſtles, where the Guns reach and Command one another; in theſe places <hi>Drake</hi> braved the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and did Exploits worthy the Fame of his Countrey. <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> (ſo called by <hi>Didacus Niqueſa,</hi> who after many croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at Sea, firſt Landed here, Founding this and <hi>Portobel,)</hi> is now in a manner forſaken, by reaſon of the little Commodiouſneſs or Security of the Harbour, lying open to the inſults of Pyrates, and more for the unhealthfulneſs of the Air com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the Sea, and ſome Lakes near it, ſo that it was once removed, by an Order from the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> in hopes that the Air might become more healthful in placing it ſome little diſtance from the Sea, but it little availed.</p>
               <p>In this part of the <hi>Indies</hi> it was, that our Valiant, tho' Unfortunate Country-Man, <hi>John Oxenham,</hi> Arriving with about 60 Companions, drew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore his Ship, covered it with Boughs, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over Land cut down Timber in the Woods, of which, he made a Pinnace, and Navigating the South-Sea, took ſeveral <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prizes, richly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Gold and Silver, and ſafely recovered the main Land; but there by the Mutiny of his
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57084:118"/> Company, about ſharing the Booty, all miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for they gave the <hi>Spaniards</hi> time to ſet upon, and cut ſeveral of them off, among whom he fell, Courageouſly Fighting; and ſo the Riches, to the Value of a Million of Duccats, which might have plentifully ſatisfied them all, was loſt by their diviſion among themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nova Andeluza,</hi> has for its principal City <hi>Tocoio,</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> new Named St. <hi>Margrets,</hi> and an other little inferiour to it, called St. <hi>Eſpiritu,</hi> both Rich in Trade, and the Country throughout gives a good Proſpect of Plenty and Pleaſure. <hi>Nova Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> is Situate on the South-ſide of <hi>Carthagena.</hi> It contains 6 principal Cities, <hi>viz. Tungua,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be directly under the <hi>Aequator; Tochamum Popaian,</hi> a very Rich Trading City; <hi>Sta fee,</hi> or St. <hi>Faiths,</hi> an Arch-Biſhop's See, and a Court of Juſtice and Chancery, Governed by a Preſident, 6 Judges, the King's Attorney, and two High Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Court, who have allowed them out of the King's Treaſury 6000 Duccats a Year. <hi>Palama</hi> and <hi>Merida,</hi> and through this Country of <hi>Granada,</hi> lieth the Road way to <hi>Lima,</hi> all by Land. It is ſtrong, by reaſon of its Situation, much among ſtony Crags or Rocks, which environ it, and through which there are very narrow paſſages, yet is it full of pleaſant Valleys, which yield much Fruit, Corn, and <hi>Indian</hi> Maize; it affords Silver Mines, and many Golden Sand Rivers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carthagena,</hi> the laſt Province of <hi>Caſtella Aurea,</hi> is of a very Fruitful Soyl, but not without ſome evil quality; for it produces a Tree that graſped by the Hand proves a rank Poyſon, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hardly eſcapes without loſs of Life, or Member; the Chief City is <hi>Carthagena,</hi> Surprized and Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by <hi>Drake, Anno</hi> 1585. who, beſide a Rich Booty, carried from thence 230 pieces of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. It is now reaſonably well Fortified, tho' not ſo ſtrong as <hi>Portobel;</hi> the City is Fair and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rich, by reaſon of the great quantity of Pearl brought thither from <hi>Margarita,</hi> and the King's
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57084:119"/> Revenue, which for all <hi>Nova Granada,</hi> are ſent to this place; it is a Biſhop's See, and in it are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Stately Churches and Cloyſters, adorned with Riches; to this City likewiſe comes yearly ſmall Veſſels, Laden with Indico, Cochinele, and Sugar, made and had in the Country of <hi>Guatemala;</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thinking it ſafer to Ship their Goods in thoſe little Veſſels on the Lake of <hi>Granada,</hi> in <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caragua,</hi> and from thence to ſend them hither, to be Shipped in the Galeons, that come from <hi>Porto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> with the Treaſure of <hi>Peru,</hi> than to ſend them by <hi>Honduras,</hi> in which way, they have become a Prey to other Nations. The City next in Rank, is <hi>Abuida;</hi> the next, <hi>Sta Martha,</hi> Inhabited by <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who are very Rich; it is Seated on the River <hi>Abuida,</hi> otherwiſe named St. <hi>John;</hi> and <hi>Rio di Grand Venezuel,</hi> and New <hi>Cales,</hi> in this Track, are Towns of conſiderable Note, Rich, and Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and theſe three Provinces, <hi>viz. Andaluzia Nova, Nova Grana,</hi> and <hi>Carthagena,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> term it their <hi>Terafirma;</hi> for that from the North, they are the ſtrength of <hi>Peru,</hi> and the baſis of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe <hi>Pyramis.</hi>

               <p>There are yet many Rich Iſlands under the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Power, as that of <hi>Margarita,</hi> Situate in the Sea, near <hi>Caſtella Aurea,</hi> called the <hi>Jewel-Iſland,</hi> from the great quantity of Pearl and Precious Stones found about it. It is true, it is but poor in Fruit-Trees, Corn, and Herbage, having ſcarcely any upon it; the Water is likewiſe ſcarce, as is any thing good or pleaſant, ſo that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in the hot-ſeaſons will exchange a Tun of Wine for as much curious Cool Spring-Water; but the Jewels got there make large amends, by greatly enriching the People, ſo that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rich Merchants, who have 30, 40, or 50, <hi>Blackamoor</hi> Slaves, kept purpoſely to dive for Pearls, and other Precious things. Theſe are let down in Baskets, and feel about the Rocks and places where they ſuſpect they are, and will ſtay under Water a Quarter of an Hour, and when
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57084:119"/> their Breath begins to fail, they give the Sign, by pulling a Rope to thoſe on the ſurface in their Boats, to draw them up with ſuch things as they have rifled the Ocean of; and their Maſters are obliged to Feaſt and make much of them, leaſt out of a ſullen humour they ſhould under Water be careleſs of ſo weighty a buſineſs, where they cannot ſee them act, nor give them directions; for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though they love the Profit, are themſelves averſe to the fatigue and hazard in procuring it; for many times theſe poor Divers are drawn up with a Leg or an Arm off, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken quite away by ſome devouring Sea-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Fiſh; at other times when they Dive without a Basket or Rope, they are ſucked by the Water under the hollow caveties of the Rock, whence they cannot with all their ſtrugling diſentangle themſelves, but there unavoidably periſh. From this Iſland, the Pearls are ſent to be dreſſed and bored at <hi>Carthagena;</hi> where is a Fair Street, of no other Shops than Pearl-dreſſers. Commonly in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> there is a Ship or two ready in this Iſland to carry the King's Revenue, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's Pearls thither; and one of their Cargoes is ſeldom valued at leſs than three or fourſcore Thouſand Duccats, which ſometimes falls into the Hands of Free-Booters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cuba,</hi> is an other Iſland, 300 Miles in length, and 70 broad, found out by <hi>Columbus,</hi> in his ſecond Navigation to theſe Coaſts; it is full of Woods, Lakes, Rivers and Mountains, the Air Temperate, the Soil very Fruitful. It produces Braſs of exact perfection, and ſome Gold, though not ſo fine as in other parts. It abounds with Ginger, Caſſia, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, Aloes, ſome Cinnamon, Canafiſtula, Sarſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parilla and Sugar, great ſtore of Fiſh, Fowls, and other Fleſh; ſo that the ſhips on their return to <hi>Spain,</hi> take in much Proviſion here. The chief Cities are St. <hi>Jago</hi> on the Northern Shoar, but <hi>James de Valaſco</hi> is a Biſhop's See. <hi>Havana,</hi> which is alſo ſeated on the Northern Shoar, and is a very
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57084:120"/> commodious Haven for Shiping, ſo ſtrongly Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> term it the Key of <hi>America,</hi> to lock up the Door or Entrance; here uſually Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Navy, and in this Port meet all the Merchants Ships from ſeveral Ports and Havens in Iſlands or Continent, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> joyn all the Treaſure, as I may ſay, of <hi>America,</hi> all the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Revenues, with as much more of Merchants Goods, which is often worth 30 Millions: It has two ſtrong Caſtles, one at the point of the Haven, where the Enterance lies towards the Sea, and the other on the other ſide within, almoſt over againſt it, and by reaſon the paſſage of the Entrance is ſo narrow, that not above one great Ship at a time can ſail in; theſe Caſtles admirably defend it, or may well do it againſt a ſtrong Naval Force. I took a view of theſe Caſtles, and found them very ſtrong and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, there are beſides others, 12 pieces of great Braſs Ordinance, called by the Names of the 12 Apoſtles, yet the Dutch, and other Nations, have ſometimes inſulted them in the Mouth of this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and taken conſiderable Prizes within ſight and reach of the Caſtle Guns; and in the Year 1629. they took no leſs than 7 Millions, moſt of it the King of Spain's Treaſure going for <hi>Cales,</hi> and from one Friar they took a Cabinet of Gold Chains, Pearl, and pretious Stones, worth 40000 Duccats, and forced the Galleons on ſhoar, in a River near the Port, which Miſcarriage being laid to the charge of <hi>Don Juan de Guzman Y Torres,</hi> the Admiral, at his return to <hi>Spain,</hi> he was Impriſoned, and ſoon after loſt his Head.</p>
               <p>The next that preſented was another Iſland, much greater than any I have yet mentioned, now called <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> anciently by the Natives <hi>Hatie.</hi> It is in compaſs 1500 Miles, the Air very Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, Soil fertil, and has in it ſeveral rich Mines; there is a conſiderable Town from the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coaſts, for this Iſland produces Amber, Ginger, Sugar, Hides, Wax, and many other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57084:120"/> the Gold is here very fine, and the Sugar Canes larger than in other places, ſo that one of them will fill 20, and ſometimes 30 Meaſures. The Corn uſually yields a Hundred Fold, the whole Iſland being Fertilized by 4 great Rivers proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a huge Mountain ſtanding in the Center, <hi>viz. Juna</hi> running to the Eaſt, <hi>Artihinnacus</hi> to the Weſt, <hi>Jacchius</hi> to the North, and <hi>Naibus</hi> to the South. The Woods are vaſt, and breed abundance of wild Swine, whoſe Fleſh is a great Dainty, yet the Country in many places is but thinly inhabited, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on their firſt poſſeſſing it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed about 3 Millions of the Natives.</p>
               <p>The chief City is St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> where there is a Preſident and Court of Chancery, with ſix Judges, and other proper Officers. It is likewiſe the See of an Archbiſhop, who, though he poſſeſſes not ſo great a Revenue as the Archbiſhops of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Lima,</hi> yet his Honour exceeds them, for he is Primate of all the <hi>Indies:</hi> This Iſland having been conquered, and ſettled, it bares Precedency by Antiquity; there are other rich trading Cities and Towns, as St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> St. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> St. <hi>John Maragna</hi> and <hi>Porto,</hi> where the Merchants Trade much, and are very Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>America,</hi> is at this time ſo called from <hi>Americus Veſpuſius,</hi> who claimed the Honour of naming it, tho' <hi>Columbus</hi> firſt diſcovered it, as has been already hinted. There are in all the <hi>Spaniſh Indies</hi> (for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations poſſeſs large Territories, as well as they, where at preſent, my Travels lay not, and therefore I ſhall not undertake now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them) four Archbiſhops, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Mexico, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> St. <hi>Domingo</hi> and St. <hi>Fee,</hi> and about 30 Biſhops ſubordinate to them; the publick Adminiſtration of Juſtice is Principally committed to the two Vice-Roys of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> the former reſiding at <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and the latter at the City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and with

               <p>THus having taken a Survey, and diſcribed the greater Inhabited part of the new World (as many term it, which Nature had ſo long reſerved from our Knowledge, as her private Tireing-room, that being decked in all her Beauties, and Golden Ornaments, ſhe might at length appear more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than at firſt;) purſuing my Method, I now in the cloſe come to ſpeak more particularly of the Inhabitants, and chiefly of the Indians, for the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, Cuſtoms and Religion of the Spaniards, which vary little in this diſtant Region, are already ſufficiently known to Europeans.</p>
               <p>The Indians are Vaſſals to the Spaniards, and for the moſt part little better than Slaves, to be at their Beck, and fulfill their imperious deſires with
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57084:121"/> the labour of their Bodies, and the little Wealth they can ſcrape together, for though in the Towns alloted them, where they are in any Number, they are allowed Officers of their own, yet they dare act little without the concurrence of the Spaniſh Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, even among their own Tribes; and to keep their courage low, they are deprived of offenſive Weapons, and great Penalties laid on ſuch, where, upon ſearch, they ſhall be found. The Friars and other Eccleſiaſticks, command their ſervice for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, having a certain number allowed at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick charge of other Indians to do their Drudgery, as fetching Water, Wood, Fiſhing for them, Till<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Sowing their Ground, and the Seculars al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them but half a Ryal a day, though they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them to leave their own Land untilled, leaving their Families to come many Miles to ſerve their turns; and to this, they are preſſed to ſevere Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, being inflicting on the Refuſer for a ſet num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of days, as ſhall be required, and many times theſe poor Wretches leave their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſtarving at Home in the mean time; and when they have done their Work, they are ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with little or nothing, except ſometimes Threats and Cudggeling, if they dare diſpute it, or ſo much as murmur at what is ſaid to them, or elſe turned over to an other that will give the Spaniard any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for their Labour, according to the firſt, or ſtanding Agreement, though the work be never ſo hard, or above their ſtrength; though indeed, they are moſtly of very ſtrong Bodies, and well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in their Limbs, and would be far more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious than they are, had they any tolerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. But ſeeing their Lives and Eſtates are at the mercy of the Conquerors, few, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their vaſt Number, ſtrive to encreaſe Riches, but content themſelves with a ſupply of ordinary Food and Rayment, going moſtly Bare-footed in all Seaſons, and any Paſſenger travelling the Road, may require an Officer to furniſh him with an
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57084:122"/> Indian or <hi>Moor,</hi> to guide his Mules, and carry hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey Trunks; and after they cavel with them at the Journeys end, for ſome pretended neglect, and ſend them back with Blows inſtead of the promiſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their labour. If they refuſe to Work when ordered, or run away when Hired, they are ſought out by the Officers, and publickly Whipt in the Market place; this, and more ſevere Uſuage, than I think fit to name, leaſt it ſhould not be credited amongſt compaſſionate Chriſtians, makes many of them weary of their Lives; ſo that coming Home from theſe Labours and Abuſes, they have refuſed to Ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>As for their Religion, ſome in the remoter parts are ſtill Heathen Idolaters, paying Adorarion as covertly, as they can the imaginary God's of their Anceſters, and lay a great ſtreſs on their Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Fire, Air, the Sun, Moon, and other things by ſeveral Names; for anciently they Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great number of Gods, and had ſtately Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Erected to them, ſacrificing Human Fleſh and Blood on their Altars, either of Priſoners ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in War with one another, or ſuch as volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily offered themſelves, or were choſen by Lot: The Names of their ſeveral Idols, and manner of their Antient Worſhip not being proper to my Subject, but rather for a Hiſtory. I ſhall paſs them over, however at preſent, they have a kind of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Eſteem, or a kind of Veneration for certain Beaſts, which they make exceeding much of, and cheriſh as their Gaurdians or Titul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing that they like them the better, and comply with the Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on payed to them, becauſe it agreed with the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their Anceſtors. Thoſe that are able, are very careful to buy the Picture of one Saint or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as their fancy leads them, and give the Prieſt Money to have a place for it in the Church; and by this a great deal of Money is ſcrewed out of them, for from that time the Prieſt ſtiles the Party, the Patron of that Saint, and he is obliged to bring Offerings, and leave before him, eſpecially on his Day, very conſiderable, which being left, the Prieſt ſweeps away, and Converts it to his own uſe, ſelling then the Wax Candles they offer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times over and over, which, with other things, brings a great Income. Where there is a number of theſe Saints in a Church, and often he ſtirs them up with Tauntings and Revilings, to mind it as a Duty, or to expect ſome great puniſhment from their angry Saint, if they ſlack in their Offerings, and many times he lays hold of Sickneſs in their Families, or Death of Cattle, telling them for want of their Offerings, and neglect of their Devotion and Charity, their ſlighted Saint is Angry, and has thus puniſhed them, which frights them into large Contributions; on which, the Prieſts lives Fat, and laughs in his Sleave at their Simplicity and Ignorance. Yet for all this, he himſelf ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fears the Saint, that he will throw his Picture out of the Church, if the party who owned him dies, and none of his Kindred, or others, come at a ſet time, after Proclamation made, with their Offering, to own and new Patronize him, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch Saints as have none to offer to them, are uſeleſs and incumber the places in the Church, where others might ſtand who have Patrons that would bring Offerings; and the Picture being thrown out of the Church, is carried to the Town-Houſe,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57084:123"/> and then if the Friends of the Owner will have it again, they muſt pay the price that will be ſet upon it, which is uſually more than it coſt at firſt.</p>
               <p>The Indians are very Ignorant in their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and undiſcerning in matters of Religion; for if they be asked any material point, their uſual anſwer is, <hi>It may be ſo for ought they know;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, thoſe that ſhould be their Spiritual Guides, labour to keep them as Ignorant as they can, that they may the better work their Ends on them, though when they come to Church, they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in Jeſtures appear very Devout, and are careful when at the point of Death, to have a Confeſſor, and receive the Extream Unction, tho' ſome of the heads of them that are ſomewhat more Learned than the reſt, are held ſecretly to practice Magyck, and traffick with the Devil; ſome affirm they can change their ſhapes into Beaſts and Birds, and in that ſhape, ſome of them have been ſhot, yet as ſoon as Dead, they were in their own ſhape again; though this, I believe, may be a tale of ſome <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had Murthered them, and forged it upon them to excuſe their own Guilt. Yet this is certainly Recorded, that one <hi>Gomez</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez,</hi> Heads of <hi>Indian</hi> Tribes, and both in years, who had ſeemed very Devout in the Romiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, were juſtified by ſeveral Witneſſes, to be ſeen Fighting on a Mountain; the firſt, in the ſhape of a Lyon, and the latter, in that of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and when the firſt came home, he was much Bruiſed, Bitten and Wounded, and of it ſoon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and though he confeſſed nothing of it to the Prieſt, who Confeſſed him, and gave him the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Unction, yet the latter by the Spaniſh Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, was ſeized and Tryed, and hang'd as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gycian, or a Practiſer of Charms and Witchcraft. Its true, they had been a long time mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the one might be guilty of the other's
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57084:123"/> death; but as for their transforming their ſhapes, that I leave to believed, or diſ-believed, at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>The Indians keep the Feſtivals of the Romiſh Church with great Mirth and Jolitry, Singing and Dancing; to conclude them after an Antick faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they act the Show of the Wiſe Mens coming to Chriſt at his Nativity, with their Offerings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their Churches or Chappels, and have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing prepared there ſuitable to that purpoſe, making great Mirth and Feaſting after it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and on ſuch days the Prieſts fairs well, for there are few that offer not Money, but Fowl, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, Coco-Nuts, Wax, Tapers, and the richeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, are procured to preſent the Kings of the Eaſt, who fail not to provide Gold, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and Mirrh, and all this falls to the Prieſt's ſhare who manages the Show.</p>
               <p>Their Funerals are after the Romiſh Faſhion, unleſs upon ſome Diſguſt they are refuſed Chriſtian Burial, but that may be recalled for Money; they Marry, and live very peaceably in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the Women being very Obedient to their Husbands, owning them to be their Lords and Rulers, thinking nothing they can do too much for them; they are very Fruitful in Children, and moſt commonly Healthy, ſo that though ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of them have been purpoſely Deſtroyed, conſumed in the Mines, and put in Lakes and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, yet the Spaniards, who are not by half ſo Fruitful, are but a handful in Number to them, though theſe few have ſo broken their Spirits, and kept them under, that now they are of no Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage comparable to what Hiſtorians Report of their Anceſters, who diſputed it in many well fought and Bloody Battles with the Spaniards, putting them hard to it before they could bring them under ſubjection, and ſettle what is now, by the Pope's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,

               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:57084:124"/>
               <p> As for their lying, it is only in Mantles wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped about them, in their Houſes, on the bare Ground, or ſome Mat or Quilt under it; the better ſort have two Rooms on a Floar, without any other Story; the poor have but one; the Chimney is in the middle of the Kitchen, and a hole made for the Smoak to go out at the Top of the Houſe, ſo that the Soot ſpreads the Roof, and they live in a continued Smoak, whilſt their Fires laſt; their Meat they ſell to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> is courſe, ſaving their Fowl, as Shins of Beef, ſliced and dried in the Wind, then ſeaſoned with Salt and Water, and rowled up in little hard lumps, which boyled, ſerves them in their Travels; they make likewiſe Frixola's of Turkey-Beans and Maize, of which, they have great plenty, and induſtriouſly ſeek for Hedge-Hogs in the Seaſon, which they count a dainty Diſh, and the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> alſo Eat them, they Taſting like a Sucking-Pig; but whether this Creature is Fleſh or not, or to be Eaten in Lent, there is yet a Diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Prieſts; ſome allow the Eating of them, others contradict them; ſo nice are they in frivolous ſcruples, when in weightier things their Conſciences are not touched. When the <hi>Indians</hi> get Veniſon in the Woods they Bury it, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it with Boughs, until it corrupts or ſtinks, then they parboyl it with a Herb like our Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, then dry it in the Wind, and afterwards in Smoak, and ſo boyl it well; and indeed it Eats very ſhort, but according to their Dreſſing not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Savory; they have other ſorts of Proviſions, yet are but indifferent Cooks.</p>
               <p>Their Liquor is chiefly Chochalet, made ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, with Coco-Nuts, and ſome other ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, but not Coſtly, with Spices and Perſumes, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> make it; when they have a mind to be Drunk, they have another ſort of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,

               <p>This Country is often ſubject to the Plague of Locuſt, as well as violent Earthquakes, prodige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thunders and Lightnings, and in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces great innundations; yet by theſe Calamities the Prieſts gain much Money, by carrying the Saints in Proceſſion, and Selling them Bread ſtamped with the Image of a Saint, to protect their Perſons, Fields, and Houſes, and much more Money for Maſſes, to the Saints, when the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities is over, by whoſe Interceſſion, they make the <hi>Indians</hi> believe, it ceaſed.

               <p>Thus Reader having, as I think, given you a ſatisfactory Account of this Golden Country and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57084:125"/> People, tired with long Travel, I now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to return to my Native Country. You may remember I was got as far as <hi>Havan,</hi> and gave you alſo an Account of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> &amp;c. being then ſucceſsfully Embarked with the Gallies, without meeting any oppoſition from Enemies, though we heard there were ſeveral abroad; we wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered two or three Storms, and loſt but one Ship in the Gulf or Streights of <hi>Bahama,</hi> of 600 Tun, very Richly Laden; and having at length a proſperous Gale, came to <hi>Cales</hi> in 8 Weeks, from our laſt looſing Anchor. I had got ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Value in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which I Quilted up in my Cloaths and Bed, it lying in a ſmall room; and after I had viewed the Town, (which is now Fairly Built, and well Fortified, though in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made themſelves Maſters of it, and almoſt deſtroyed it,) I went to viſit my Merchant, who received me with great kindneſs, asking many Queſtions of my Travels, which in brief I reſolved him, and made him ſenſible how deſirous I was to return to my own Country; and after ſo tedious a Travel of almoſt encompaſſing the Globe of the Earth, there to repoſe my ſelf, and keep my Promiſe with my Friends, who I knew would be overjoyed to ſee me return; he did not oppoſe it, but kept me off with delays, in laying before me the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I was in, of being taken by the <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Barbary</hi> Corſaries, that infeſted the Seas, unleſs I ſtaid for a Convoy; I was ruled by him, and he entertained me with all the Civility imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, and no ſooner the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships were to Sail, and ſuch an opportunity offered, but he gave me notice of it, preſented me with Raſins, Sugar, Oranges, Lemons, and a Cask of good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; ſent ſeveral Letters by me to his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents in <hi>London,</hi> and ſo we friendly took leave of each other. I ſoon agreed for my Paſſage and Diet, at the Maſter's Table, and ſo to be brief,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57084:126"/> came ſafe to <hi>London;</hi> where, my Friends after ſo long abſence, my Speech being much altered in Toneing the Languages of divers Nations where I had been, ſcarce knew me, though before to their great ſatisfaction I had written to them, from the <hi>Downs,</hi> of my ſafe Arrival there; but when they ſaw by evident looking, it was their Prodigal returned in ſafety from ſtrange Lands, after ſo much Toil, Fateigue, and Hardſhip, the Eſcaping ſo many dangers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Fatted Calf, was inſtantly Killed, great Feaſting and Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing enſued, which being moderated by time, and a little over, to avoid ten Thouſand Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of where I had been, and the particulars of what I obſerved, at the Requeſt of thoſe that had done ſo well for me, and now ſo Lovingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me, I took leiſure time to Write what you have peruſed, hoping it will give my Country-Men as an entire ſatisfaction as I have had, in the undertaking and performing my Travels, and then no doubt but both of us will be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
